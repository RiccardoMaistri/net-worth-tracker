  # three oranges and two teals (Liquidità measured ΔE00 10.1 from Immobili, Trend Following
  # 16.2 from Obbligazioni) and drew the hero's curve in the hue of --destructive. The floor is

  # out in section 3 (Typography) and enforced by "the jump from 22->36->44->54 is
  # intentional". It lives here because the roles alone cannot express a ramp, and the
  # machine-readable layer must agree with the prose — otherwise tooling reads the

# Design System: Net Worth Tracker

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "Effortless Precision"**

This system is built for one purpose: total clarity about your financial position. The design ambition is to be the Apple of personal finance trackers — not the most feature-rich instrument, but the one that makes you immediately understand your financial situation, beautifully and effortlessly. Every element earns its place by communicating a number, a trend, or a relationship. The aesthetic draws from three co-primary references: Linear/Vercel clarity, Trade Republic data hierarchy, and Apple's effortless premium.

**Linear / Vercel** provides the structural foundation: tight geometry, achromatic palette, strong typography, physics-native motion, zero decorative chrome.

**Trade Republic** provides the data hierarchy: the primary number dominates physically and visually. Layout flows vertically — dominant value → inline variation chip → small label metadata. Flat `divide-y` lists instead of card-within-card nesting. No decorative progress bars. No box-within-box. Visual chrome is reduced to its structural minimum: only what separates, never what decorates.

**Apple (Stocks, Wallet, Health)** provides the quality benchmark: complex data made effortlessly readable. Generous whitespace as a design material — not wasted space, but earned breathing room. Light mode equally premium to dark. Surfaces that feel considered and valuable. Progressive disclosure: the essential at a glance, depth on interaction. The interface recedes so the numbers speak.

The three references are compatible. All share zero tolerance for decoration that doesn't carry information, strong typography as structure, and the conviction that simplicity is harder to achieve than complexity.

**The Unifying Law — Form Follows Function.** Beneath all three references sits a single conviction, the one Jony Ive carries forward from the modernist tradition: form follows function. Every visual property of every element — its size, weight, color, position, motion, even its corner radius — is a *consequence* of what that element does, never a costume applied to it afterward. A number is large because it is the most important fact on the screen, not because "large" looks impressive. A border is 1px at 10% opacity because that is precisely the contrast required to separate — no more. Motion exists to reveal a relationship the eye would otherwise miss. When form and decoration disagree, function wins, every time. Three corollaries follow Ive's reading of the principle: **honesty** — a surface never fakes a depth, material, or state it doesn't have (no false glass, no invented shadow hierarchy); **deference** — the interface is a quiet instrument that recedes so the data can speak; **inevitability** — a well-resolved element looks like the only possible answer, as if it could not have been otherwise. This law is the *why* behind every rule that follows: zero-chroma, the Mono Mandate, ambient elevation, chrome reduction — each is form bending to function, not the reverse.

Both dark and light modes are primary, equally refined experiences. An Italian investor reviewing portfolio performance deserves precision and premium quality regardless of their environment or preference.

The five named color themes (Solar Dusk, Elegant Luxury, Midnight Bloom, Cyberpunk, Retro Arcade) are personality layers on top of a structural foundation. They change accent and surface palette — and, since each declares its own `--radius`, the derived `sm`–`xl` corners (`rounded-md` is 8px on the default theme and 2px on Retro Arcade) — without touching the type scale, the component API, or the tile's fixed 16px `2xl` (corrected 2026-09-06; see the `rounded` comment in the frontmatter). The default theme is the instrument in its raw state. The themes are its finishes.

**The 2026-08-22 turn — Verdict over Tiles.** The Panoramica redesign settled the shape every page will take: a *verdict* — one rule-generated sentence that answers the page's question before any number — over a *grid of tiles*, each answering one question with a one-line reading above its figures. Chrome stays what it was (achromatic, 16px cards, flat rows); what changed is the order of reading: words first, then numbers, then detail. Pages are propagated onto this shape one at a time; patterns the Panoramica superseded are marked as such below and stay documented until the last page that uses them is redesigned — the propagation closed on 2026-09-01 with the twenty-third, and on 2026-09-06 every pattern left with no implementation was marked superseded in place rather than deleted. The shell followed on the same day: the compact header became the default, the sidebar and the phone drawer took the tiles' eyebrow as their group label, the assistant banner became a plain route, and the frame receded enough for the verdict to be the first thing read. Patrimonio was the first page propagated (2026-08-22, evening): the same verdict shape with an *instrument* as the driver of the month, five tiles over the hero, and the management table kept as a table but given the tile's cadence — eyebrow, reading line, then the rows (see **Table inside a Tile**). Cashflow › Tracciamento followed the same night: the verdict answers «come sta andando il mese?» for whatever period the picker selects — the picker sits beside the verdict, because it is the page's one axis — over four tiles and the transaction feed, which stays the last tile as the inventory it is (see **Feed inside a Tile** and **In-tile Bars**). Cashflow › Dividendi was the third (2026-08-23): the verdict answers «quanto rendono i miei flussi?» over six tiles, one of which — Rendimento — is measured on a window the picker cannot change and therefore names its own (see **The Off-Axis Tile Rule**), and the whole page keeps money already in the account visibly apart from money merely announced (see **The Received-vs-Announced Rule**). Cashflow › Budget was the fourth (2026-08-23): the verdict answers «sto rispettando il budget?» with no period axis at all — a budget is always read on the running month, and the one tile measured year-to-date (Budget annuali) names its own window — over five tiles whose bars carry today's mark so a used share is read against the calendar's (see **Budget Track**), and whose projected overruns and crossed thresholds never share a tile (see **The Risk-vs-Fact Rule**); the configuration (ceiling, alerts, thresholds) lives below the grid behind a disclosure, open only while no ceiling is set. Cashflow › Centri di Costo was the fifth (2026-08-23): the verdict answers «quanto sta costando il progetto?» with no period axis at all — a project's cost is its whole cost, so every figure is «in totale» and a tile measured on another window names it («quest'anno», «ultimi 12 mesi», the ceiling's own month or year with today's mark) — over three tiles for the list (the total with the trailing months stacked by center, the ranked inventory, the dormant centers) and five for one center (its cost with the ceiling's track and the month-end and year-end projections at the app's one rule, the composition by category and by subcategory with a session-only «al netto di» lens, the lifecycle dates, the linked movements), the archived centers below the grid behind a disclosure; the verdict ranks a crossed ceiling over a projected one over the most expensive center (the Risk-vs-Fact Rule again), and a dormant or archived center gets no projection (see **The Whole-Cost Corollary** under The Off-Axis Tile Rule). Analisi was the sixth (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «dove vanno i soldi, e cosa è cambiato?» for the three-mode axis the page already had (Anno corrente | Anno | Storico, with an optional month) — the axis beside the verdict, the entity search in the compact header's actions — over five tiles (the period's three figures with their year-over-year pacing and the year's spending per month beside the previous year's, the categories over their own six-month average on ONE month the tile names, the largest single expenses, the full composition of spending and of income as ranked rows that open an entity) and the app's one Sankey inside a wide tile; a focused entity is a tile of the grid too (see **Scheda inside the Grid**), the year-over-year comparison and the reference charts sit below the grid behind two disclosures, and the page keeps its deep-linked focus and its one landing path. Rendimenti was the seventh (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «quanto rende il portafoglio, e rispetto a cosa?» on the page's one axis (YTD | 1 anno | 3 anni | 5 anni | Storico beside the verdict; a custom range is a chip under it, never a slot) with the measured base named under the sentence — over six tiles (the TWR with the growth of 100 against the 60/40 drawn as a neutral baseline, the risk figures with the drawdown's months, the heatmap in the sign tokens, the ledger's capital beside the cashflow's contributions, the six model portfolios in EUR each to its own last month, the realized gains per fiscal year off the axis) and a seventh that takes the row's remainder (the invested base under the net worth); the fifteen metrics, the rolling charts, the underwater chart and the method sit below the grid behind a «Dettaglio» disclosure. Two rules came out of it: the subject names the window actually measured («Negli ultimi 11 mesi», never «Nell'ultimo anno» on eleven snapshots), and a gap printed beside a figure is on that figure's basis (see **The Same-Basis Rule**). Storico was the eighth (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «come sono arrivato qui?» with no period axis — the question is the whole history — on the growth since the first snapshot, which is WEALTH growth, contributions included, and the sentence says so («il 19,4% l'anno, versamenti inclusi») so it can never be read as Rendimenti's investment return; over five tiles (the evolution with the value today, three grouped chips and the net-worth series with the notes as markers on the line; the doublings with the page's one pace and the projected next one; the composition chapter of 2026-08 at the tile's cadence, its maths untouched; the drivers of the growth — savings beside market — from the cashflow floor, the one window on the page, named in the aside; and every instrument of a month with its change split into price and quantity) and a «Dettaglio» disclosure of four tiles (the year-over-year variation, savings and market month by month, the labor recap, the notes). One rule came out of it, a corollary of the Same-Basis Rule: a page that projects has ONE pace, and every sentence that judges speed uses it (see **The One-Pace Corollary**). Hall of Fame was the ninth (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «quali sono stati i mesi e gli anni migliori?» with no period axis — a record is a POSITION, not a period — over five tiles (the net-worth records with five positions, the twelve record months dated on a chart and the worst month in the footer; the months with the most income; a ranking the redesign added, what a month KEPT — income minus expenses, only where income was recorded; the years; and the notes the user filed on their own records) with a «Dettaglio» disclosure of one tile that holds the full ranking, twenty months or ten years, for any of the ten combinations. The switcher that used to sit above everything — `Mensile|Annuale` and `Crescita|Calo|Entrate|Spese` — went INTO that disclosure, because on the grid each ranking is already a tile and a control over them would answer the same question twice. One rule came out of it (see **The Ranking-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule**). Allocazione was the tenth (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «sono allineato al piano, e cosa faccio con i prossimi soldi?» with no period axis — an allocation is read today — over five tiles (the balance: the band-independent score as an 84px ring beside the share out of position and the count of classes off target under the band, the current mix over the target mix as two bars on ONE legend, and a footer on what the total holds but cannot move and what it leaves out; the plan, with Ribilancia | Versa | Preleva as the tile's aside and an amount the page owns; every class as one line with its current and target share, its gap in euro and a 3px tick, sub-categories and theoretical targets inline; the look-through exposure, fetched on mount from the 24h cache, as ranked rows closed by the rest of the portfolio; the pension fund's mix beside the whole account's) and a «Dettaglio» disclosure of two tiles, the non-tradable and the excluded holdings. The page's one control — the rebalance band — re-classifies the chips without moving the score, so it is a SCOPE and not an axis: it lives in the Bilanciamento tile's aside, and the verdict's last clause is always the Versa answer at the Piano's amount (see **The Scope-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule**). FIRE › Calcolatore was the eleventh (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «quando?» with no period axis — a plan is read today, on the last full cashflow year — naming the year and the age of the base scenario, the gap to the FIRE number, the monthly pace and the passive income the plan lands on in both moneys («2300 € al mese di oggi, 2667 € del 2032 con l'inflazione al 2,5%»), plus the pension capital locked and its unlock year when the bridge model is on; over four tiles (the target: the FIRE number as the hero figure, the progress as a chip over a 3px track and the projection filling the tile in the Scenari or the Ventaglio view, switched by the tile's aside; the base the number runs on, with the page's one switch — the pension lock — saving on change; the passive income today; the three scenarios as rows) and two disclosures below the grid — «Parametri» (the SWR, the residence rule, the RITA details and the scenarios' parameters, open only until an SWR is saved) and «Dettaglio» (the historical runway, the cashflow history, the explainer). One rule came out of it (see **The In-Tile Switch Rule**). FIRE › Coast FIRE was the twelfth (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «posso smettere di versare?» with no period axis — a Coast plan is read today — naming the gap to the Coast number of today, what the free capital becomes at the target age against what is required there, the state pensions' share of the expenses, net and real («dal 2052 la Pensione estera e dal 2055 la Pensione INPS coprono insieme 1120 € al mese») and, with the bridge model on, the locked fund that counts in neither capital figure; over three tiles (the target: the shortfall as the hero figure, the progress as a chip over a 3px track with the liquid read and what the number discounts beside it, and the projection filling the tile with the required capital as a dashed line that STEPS with the fund when it re-enters; the inflows the walk already discounts as an ordered rail, every amount at today's value; the three scenarios as rows, each with its own Coast number) and two disclosures below the grid — «Ipotesi» (the form as four tiles with ONE save, open only until an age is saved) and «Dettaglio» (the coverage phases, the target beside the steady state, the pensions' impact, how to read it). The page has no control of its own: the pension lock is the Calcolatore's switch, and the Ipotesi trigger names its state. One rule came out of it (see **The Stepped-Line Rule**). FIRE › What If was the thirteenth (2026-08-25): the verdict answers «cosa cambia se…?» with no period axis — an event is applied today, at year 0 — taking its headline and its tone from the delta in years («Il FIRE slitta di 1 anno.», «Il FIRE si avvicina di 2 anni.», «Il FIRE resta nel 2033.», «L'evento ti toglie il FIRE.») and naming, each with its bounds, what the event does to the capital, the FIRE number, the year, the passive income and the Coast plan — the event itself said in the pure layer's terms («12 mesi senza 31.800 € l'anno di entrate (il 64% del reddito)»), never a category; over four tiles (the two base-scenario walks drawn over each other, the plan of today as a neutral baseline, with the divergence read at the FIRE year of today — «i 31.800 € persi oggi sono 51.200 € di distanza allora»; every figure as a before → after row with its signed change, the FIRE block and the Coast block; the event form as a tile of the grid, the income sources that stop and the hit decomposed under it; the sensitivity matrix on the plan of today, off the event, at the tile's cadence). The page has no disclosure: its one control is the form, and on a phone it is the first tile after the verdict. One rule came out of it (see **The Input Tile Rule**). FIRE › Monte Carlo was the fourteenth (2026-08-26): the verdict answers «quanto è probabile?» with no period axis — a plan is simulated today — taking its tone from the success rate of the base scenario («Il piano regge nell'84,2% dei casi.», «Il piano regge in ogni simulazione.») and naming the share of simulations in which the capital holds to the age, the median final value of ALL of them, the year the worst tenth runs out, the bear and bull probabilities and the pension bridge; over four tiles (the probability as the hero figure with the failures, the median failure year and the survivors as grouped chips and the fan of the base scenario filling the tile; the final values as three percentiles and a ten-bin histogram whose last bin takes the tail, the median's bin outlined; the three scenarios as rows with a 3px track each; the plan as a tile of the grid in its desktop position — the plan is auto-filled, so the page is answered before anything is typed — with the three market scenarios as bordered parameter tiles) and a «Dettaglio» disclosure of three tiles (the three medians over each other, the percentiles every five years, how it works). The mode toggle that used to split a single run from the scenario comparison is gone: ONE run is the three scenarios, and the Base is the reference of every other tile. One rule came out of it (see **The Stale-Run Rule**). FIRE › Obiettivi was the fifteenth (2026-08-26): the verdict answers «sono in rotta?» with no period axis — a goal is read today — judging only the DATED goals («Sei in rotta su ogni obiettivo.», «Un obiettivo su tre è in ritardo.», «Ogni obiettivo datato è in ritardo.», «Nessun obiettivo in corso ha una scadenza.») and giving every goal its clause: the late ones with the extra pace their deadline asks («Casa richiede 270 € al mese in più per arrivare a giugno 2029»), the ones in time with their deadline, the undated with their arrival, the open ones as open, the reached ones last; over five tiles (every goal as a row in urgency order, the first large, with its 3px track in the goal's own colour, a verdict chip and the words after it — pressing a row selects the goal; the selected goal's trajectory: the value at the deadline as the hero figure, four grouped chips and the glide path filling the tile, the goal's two actions in the aside; the milestones as a rail, the reached first, then the projected arrivals, then the goals the pace never reaches — a late goal keeps its projected date and carries the lateness; the allocation the goals derive over the one the quotas hold, two bars on ONE legend, only with goal-driven allocation on; the quotas grouped by goal beside the free shares, closed by «Non assegnato» so the tile adds up to the portfolio) and a «Dettaglio» disclosure of two tiles (the next contribution split by gap × priority, how it works). One rule came out of it (see **The Selected-Row Rule**). Previdenza was the sixteenth (2026-08-26), and the last page on the legacy header: the verdict answers «il fondo sta lavorando?» on the page's one axis — the fiscal year, beside the verdict — naming, per contributor, the three causes of growth as three numbers («Il fondo di Mario vale 31.450 €: da novembre 2025 il mercato ha reso +7,96% (TWR), nel 2026 il datore ha aggiunto 134 € e il fisco restituisce circa 275 €.»), or the reason the return is not a measure in place of the percentage; over five tiles (the fund today: the live value as the hero figure, this month's market effect — the same figure the Panoramica's digest prints — and everything ever paid in as grouped chips, the value series closed on the live value filling the tile; the return, off the axis and naming its window: the TWR as the KPI with the annualised figure under it, the market gain, the return on one's own capital and the employer's share kept apart; the fiscal year: the IRPEF saving as the KPI over a 3px track of what was deducted against the ceiling, the extra plafond beneath; the year's contributions by nature as ranked rows; the ledger of the year as a table at the tile's cadence with a two-click delete) and a «Dettaglio» disclosure of two tiles (the euro-by-euro decomposition, only where the return is a measure; how the value is kept current). One rule came out of it (see **The Three-Causes Rule**). The Assistente was the seventeenth (2026-08-27), and the one page whose content is not a grid: the verdict answers «su quali numeri ragiona l'assistente?» — it IS the context — on the page's one axis (Mese · Anno · YTD · Storico · Libera with its sub-picker, beside the verdict): for a period the rule-generated sentence of `assistantNarrative.ts` in the period's own tense («Luglio è andato bene.», «Il 2025 è stato un anno in crescita.», «Il 2026 finora va bene.», «Dal 2021 il patrimonio è cresciuto.», «Di luglio conosco solo il cashflow.»), for a free question with no period the Panoramica's own verdict on the live payload, reused verbatim; under it the hero is the one `[2fr_1fr]` left in the app — the conversation as a tile (the starter questions as flat rows, the thread as flat messages, the follow-ups as rows) with the composer sticky under it, and a sticky `self-start` companion column of tiles at the Panoramica's cadence (the period's net worth as a 36px hero with its chip and the journey from its start as the reading; the cashflow as flat rows; what the memory holds, every active goal with its last check) — with a «Come funziona» disclosure of three tiles below the grid, where the header's «?» went. The Memoria sheet became two tiles (Obiettivi, with the durable «Ignora» on a goal the daily check found reached, and Fatti) and the «goal reached» banner a tile above the conversation. One rule came out of it (see **The Conversation-Is-Content Rule**). On 2026-08-28 the meaning of a period itself was revised on Tracciamento and Analisi — a running year is the whole year, «Da inizio anno» is the window that runs to the end of the current month, and what is only in the calendar is declared rather than hidden (see **The Scheduled-Is-Not-Spent Rule**). Impostazioni was the eighteenth propagation (2026-08-29), and the one that has NO verdict: a form measures nothing, so there is no question for a sentence to answer — what it takes is the cadence, with every group of settings a tile whose reading states the current state in words («Base gestita: fondi pensione e asset esclusi restano fuori», «Bollo allo 0,2% attivo») and its controls below, one Save per page for all six tabs, and two tiles that DECLARE a state they do not own — the FIRE plan's parameters and the assistant's preferences — linking the surface that writes them. One rule came out of it (see **The Declaration-Tile Rule**). Accesso e Registrazione was the nineteenth (2026-08-30), and the smallest: the two public pages take the cadence without the grid — a 420px column with the eyebrow, the verdict and ONE tile, the form, because a form is one tile and a twelve-column grid of a single cell is a grid pretending. Their verdict is the only one in the app that is not a reading of the user's data — there is none yet — but the PRODUCT's promise («Il tuo patrimonio, spiegato prima che misurato.»), still generated by rules over the page's state (accesso · registrazione aperta · su invito · chiusa) so the whitelist clause can honestly disappear and the closed door has its own headline; the tone stays neutral in every state, because a promise that flipped to negative on a mistyped password would be the page disowning itself over a typo. One rule came out of it (see **The Status-Is-The-Reading Rule**). **La landing pubblica** was the twentieth (2026-08-31): it is the Panoramica told to someone who has no data yet, so it takes the whole cadence — compact header, verdict, twelve-column grid — and renders the app's OWN tiles (`PatrimonioTile`, `CashflowTile`, `ComposizioneTile`, `ObiettivoTile`, period selector and count line included) on an invented profile, because a mock-up of a product ages the moment the product changes; its verdict is the same promise the sign-in page makes, word for word, generated from the one state it has (a demo account exists, or the clause and the button both disappear); three further tiles carry NO figures at all and say what a section computes, every fact in them read from the module that owns it — six benchmarks from the benchmark list, ten thousand paths per scenario from the Monte Carlo default, the deduction ceiling from the pension module — so a claim cannot outlive what it describes. What it dropped: the ring chart for the savings rate (the app's last `useAnimation`), the icon-per-feature list, the four-cell proof strip whose first cell said «6 classi di asset» while the union had eight, and a marketing headline that was neither the verdict's size nor anything on the ramp. One rule came out of it (see **The Sample-Data Rule**). **Dialog e form trasversali** was the twenty-first (2026-08-31), and the first propagation that is not a page: 29 modal surfaces onto ONE vocabulary — eyebrow · title · reading · body · footer — with `ResponsiveModal` (Drawer ≤768, Dialog above) as the single implementation, four named widths, the Float shadow on a `bg-card` surface, and the reading doubling as the form's status line. It is where the app's error copy stopped being an SDK string (`describeWriteError` is to a write what `describeAuthError` is to a sign-in) and where the last three 3-second auto-disarm timers went. One rule came out of it (see **The Modal-Is-A-Tile Rule**). **Stati** was the twenty-second (2026-09-01), and the second that is not a page: the four shapes an absence can take — waiting · nothing recorded · a measured zero · a failed read — resolved on 20 surfaces, where 17 of them used to render zeros. One rule came out of it (see **The Absence-Has-Three-Names Rule**). **Email e PDF** was the twenty-third (2026-09-01), and the first propagation onto surfaces that have no DOM at all: a mail client and `@react-pdf/renderer` never see `globals.css`, so every colour there had to be a literal, and over two years those literals had drifted into palettes the app does not own — the emails ran on Tailwind's slate ramp and the PDF on a blue accent that broke the Zero-Chroma Rule on every page. They now take their hexes from ONE module that mirrors the default theme token by token (see **The Out-Of-DOM Token Rule**), and their shape from the same cadence as every page: a rule-generated verdict, then tiles. The email's verdict is generated rather than borrowed from the AI comment, which is optional by design — an opening that can vanish is not an opening; the PDF's cover stopped being a frontispiece and became the report's verdict. Two rules came out of it (see **The Out-Of-DOM Token Rule** and **The Declared-Window Rule**).

**The Absence-Has-Three-Names Rule** (Stati, 2026-09-01). A tile that cannot answer says **which** of three things happened — **nothing is recorded** · **something is, and it is zero** · **the read failed** — because the three ask the reader for three different actions, and printing a zero for either of the other two is the one thing a tracker must never do. Each name has its own form, all three at the tile's own cadence: **nothing recorded** is the reading line in `text-muted-foreground`, under the tile's own eyebrow, carrying no figure and at most ONE action (`EmptyState`); **a measured zero** prints the figure, in `font-mono` like every other figure, because zero is an answer and hiding it takes from the reader the only thing the app knows; **a failed read** is an `ErrorNotice` — `role="alert"`, the eyebrow in `--destructive` («Classi · lettura fallita»), one sentence naming what was not read and one naming what was **not touched**, the second being the one that stops a reader reaching for a backup. Five corollaries. **The action belongs to the tile that owns the absence, and to no other**: a page whose hero asks «Aggiungi il primo strumento» has three other tiles that state the same absence and stay silent, because asking four times for one thing is not four affordances. **A wait is a fourth state, not an absence**: `TileGridSkeleton` is the whole of it, its pulse behind `motion-safe:`, ONE `role="status"` for the block with every placeholder `aria-hidden` — and a page must never enter it on a FAILED query, which is a skeleton that cannot lift (`resolveSurfaceState` in `lib/utils/statesNarrative.ts` decides; `loading` wins over `failed`, because a retry is an attempt and not a verdict). **A failed read never falls through to the empty branch**: `[]` from a dropped connection is indistinguishable from `[]` on a new account, so the alert is checked BEFORE the verdict about an empty set, and a service that swallows its own failure into zeros has to be made to reject instead. **An empty state is never an illustration**: the centred 104px icon with a perpetual 6px float was the largest element of a tile carrying no information, and it dropped the eyebrow — the tile's question — exactly when the tile could not answer it. **Severity is carried where no text sits**: on a toast, the icon and a 2px rule on the leading edge take the semantic token while the surface stays `--popover`; a 10% sign tint would wash the fill with the text's own hue, which this system already records as structurally below AA.

**The Modal-Is-A-Tile Rule** (Dialog e form trasversali, 2026-08-31). A modal is a TILE lifted off the page, so it takes the tile's anatomy — eyebrow (the context, and after a centred dot the scope: «Nuova voce · Passo 1 di 2», «Registro operazioni · VWCE»), title at the Headline step (20px/600/−0.01em, naming the ACT and not the surface: «Nuova spesa variabile», never «Modulo spesa»), reading line, body — plus the one thing a tile has no use for: a **footer**, because a modal asks for a decision and a tile only reports. It also takes the tile's material: `bg-card`, 1px border, 16px radius. What it adds is the **Float shadow**, the one large shadow in the system, because a modal is the canonical element that leaves document flow (see **The Float Threshold**) — before this, `DialogContent` and `DrawerContent` were painted `bg-background`, which in light mode is the same pure white as the page they float over, so the surface was lifted off nothing but a hairline. Five corollaries. **The reading IS the form's status line** (The Status-Is-The-Reading Rule, carried from /login into every modal): one sentence saying what the form wants while idle, what it is doing while it submits, and how it went — a single stable `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` node that is ALSO Radix's `Description`, so the accessible description and the live region are one element instead of two paragraphs saying one thing; an error paints it `text-destructive` and leaves the title exactly where it was, because the title states the act and a failed save is not a different act. **The width is one of four steps and no others** — 420 (one question) · 560 (one form) · 720 (a two-column form, or a list) · 960 (a report to read): the old `max-w-4xl` default was 896, which is none of them, and a six-field form at that width leaves half of every row empty. **The footer is laid out by the modal, not by the caller**: «Annulla» then the primary in DOM order, right-aligned on a dialog and `flex-col-reverse` at 44px on a drawer, so the primary action is the top row under the thumb on a phone and no caller branches on the viewport. **A destructive primary arms rather than asking**: two clicks, no timer (a countdown is a WCAG 2.2.1 time limit), the label naming the count from the same query the reading counts («Elimina 47 movimenti» → «Premi di nuovo per elimina 47 movimenti»), and Escape means DISARM while armed — refused at the modal's `onEscapeKeyDown`, because Radix's dismiss layer registers its listener when the dialog mounts and always runs before one added at arm time, capture phase included. **A summary block inside a modal is a sub-tile on `bg-muted`**, never `bg-card`, which on this surface is a card inside a card. And when a modal ANSWERS a question rather than asking one, its title IS the verdict — the page's own, reused verbatim with its tone-coloured full stop (the AI analysis modal takes `buildPerformanceVerdict`'s sentence, never the model's first line: two runs on the same numbers would open with two different judgements, and a verdict slot that changes under a fixed set of figures is not a verdict).

**The Sample-Data Rule** (landing pubblica, 2026-08-31). A surface that shows the product's own instruments filled with figures that are not the reader's declares it **once, at the head of the region it governs, in the eyebrow's voice** — «PANORAMICA · DATI D'ESEMPIO» and one 13px line naming which tiles carry invented numbers and which carry none — never as a caption under a single figure, which reads as a footnote to that figure alone and leaves every other number on the page undeclared. Three corollaries. **The arithmetic is not invented even where the figures are**: the classes sum to the total, both variations are derived from the series the chart draws, the market digest is smaller than the month's whole change (the rest is contributions, which is what a digest labelled «Mercato» must leave room for), and the month-end projection is the app's one rule — a visitor who adds two numbers and misses has been shown a broken instrument, which is the thing being sold, so the relations are pinned by tests like any other rule. **A tile that would have to invent a figure shows none**: the sections the sample cannot honestly stand in for name what they COMPUTE instead, one measure per row, and the only numbers they carry are facts about the tool, read from the module that owns them rather than typed into the copy. **A sample is a snapshot and says so, rather than half-following the clock**: the month is fixed, because a profile whose month tracked today would need its spending to track the day too, and a projection computed on the 3rd of a month is arithmetic nobody can defend.

**The Status-Is-The-Reading Rule** (Accesso e Registrazione, 2026-08-30). On a tile whose content is a FORM, the reading line is the form's status line: it says what the form wants while it is idle, what it is doing while it submits, and how it went — one sentence, in the one place the reader is already looking, instead of a reading under the eyebrow and a separate status paragraph under the button, which is the same job done twice a tile apart. Four corollaries. **The severity is the reading's, never the verdict's**: an error paints the reading `text-destructive` and leaves the headline exactly where it was, because the verdict answers the page's question and a wrong password is not an answer to it. **The live region is ONE stable node** — `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` in every phase: a container that swapped to `role="alert"` on failure is a different node to the accessibility tree, and some screen readers announce nothing across that swap; the words carry the severity instead of the role. **A failure is said in the product's own words**: a provider's error string («Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-credential).» — English, provider-named, code in parentheses) is a log line, and an unmapped code takes a sentence that claims nothing about the cause rather than falling through to it (the Narrative Honesty Rule applied to an error). **A requirement that ticks is not a gain**: the rows under a password field take the check icon and `text-foreground` when satisfied and the empty circle and `text-muted-foreground` when not — the sign tokens mean money gained and money lost (see **The Sign-Color Token Rule**), the icon carries the state, and the distinction survives a monochrome rendering. The rows must also be exactly the rules the submit enforces, read from the same predicate: a checklist that promises a constraint the validation does not apply is a lie told twice.

**The Selected-Row Rule** (FIRE › Obiettivi, 2026-08-26). When a page holds several subjects of one kind — goals — and one tile can only draw one of them, the subject is chosen by pressing a ROW of the tile that lists them, never by a control above the grid: the row carries `aria-current`, the sibling tile names the subject in its aside and its `aria-label` («Traiettoria di Casa»), the selection defaults to the most urgent row, follows a deletion, and is session-only. A selection is not an axis: the verdict and every other tile read all the subjects, and nothing on the page changes but the sibling. Three corollaries. **The subject's actions sit in the sibling's aside** (Modifica, Elimina — the Scheda's ghost buttons from `desktop:`, a full-width row of 44px targets below it; Elimina a two-click confirm without a timer), never on the rows, which would put two 28px targets on every line. **A user-chosen colour is an identity, not a chart slot**: a goal's hex paints its dot, its track, its milestone and its projection the same in every tile and on the Panoramica, because two goals sharing a hue would be indistinguishable — the classes beside them keep the app's one slot map. **A timeline never shows a deadline as an arrival**: a goal that lands after its deadline keeps its projected month and carries the lateness under the row («15 mesi dopo la scadenza di giugno 2029»); a goal the current pace never reaches reads «mai, al ritmo attuale».

**The Three-Causes Rule** (Previdenza, 2026-08-26). When a figure grows for causes of different NATURE — the market's return, the employer's compensation, the tax office's refund — the verdict names them as separate clauses with separate numbers and never blends them into one percentage: «da novembre 2025 il mercato ha reso +7,96% (TWR), nel 2026 il datore ha aggiunto 134 € e il fisco restituisce circa 275 €». A blended figure answers no question (a fund at «+15% l'anno» is compensation counted as return), and a cause with nothing behind it drops its clause rather than printing a zero. Three corollaries. **A return that is not a measure is said, through ONE predicate, everywhere it would be printed**: `returnState` decides the verdict's clause, the tile's KPI and the Dettaglio's decomposition together, so «il rendimento non è misurabile perché mancano versamenti registrati» can never sit forty pixels from a «Guadagno di mercato» in bold. **A verdict about a person's position is per person**: the IRPEF ceiling is per taxpayer, so the page reads one sentence per contributor, on that contributor's funds and contributions, and the tile prints the same TWR the sentence does; a fund linked to no one is named by its own name and gets no tax clause. **A verdict may mix the axis and an off-axis window as long as every clause names its own**: the market clause says «da novembre 2025» (the trusted window), the two annual clauses say «nel 2026» (the axis), and the tiles off the axis carry their window in the aside.

**The Conversation-Is-Content Rule** (Assistente, 2026-08-27). When a page's content is a conversation, the grid of tiles is not its shape: the hero stays `[2fr_1fr]` — the conversation on the left, a companion on the right — because the conversation IS the content and nothing else on the page competes with it. Three corollaries. **The verdict is the context**: the sentence above the conversation states the numbers the assistant will answer on, so the reader sees them before asking, and a free question with no period reuses the Panoramica's verdict builder verbatim — «come va?» has one answer per account, and a second phrasing of it would drift. **What the page cannot measure it never claims**: a period bundle carries purchases and prices together, so a falling period is «in calo», never «il mercato ha pesato», and the tense follows the period («è andato», «finora va», «è cresciuto»). **The companion is a sticky `self-start` column of tiles at the grid's cadence, and the suggestions are rows**: the starter questions, the follow-ups and the memory's goals are flat `divide-y` rows inside their tile, never chips or cards inside a card, and a proposal the assistant makes (a goal) is a muted sub-tile of the message.

**The Declaration-Tile Rule** (Impostazioni, 2026-08-29). A page whose content is a FORM has no verdict — a verdict answers a question the numbers pose, and a configuration page measures nothing — but it keeps the cadence: compact header, tab bar, then a grid where every group of settings is a tile whose reading line states the CURRENT STATE in words before its controls («Base gestita: fondi pensione e asset esclusi restano fuori», «Bollo allo 0,2% attivo», «Marcella vede e modifica tutto — spese, asset, dividendi — con le sue credenziali»). The reading names the effect DOWNSTREAM, never the widget below it: the reader is deciding, and a setting they cannot place is a setting they will not trust. Four corollaries. **A field another surface OWNS is declared, not edited**: «Parametri del piano» (SWR, spese, età INPS, RITA) and «Assistente» (stile, memoria, web) are read-only tiles — label · mono value rows and a footer that LINKS the write surface — because a second editor of one field is a second write path, and the assistant's mirror in the settings document loses on read, so an edit made there would be silently overwritten; a value never synced prints no default, the reading says where the truth lives instead. **An applicative default is named as one** («pensione INPS a 67 anni (predefinita)»): printing it like a saved choice tells the reader they decided something they did not. **One Save per page, and a tab never grows a second one** — the fields of a tab that the page's own Save already persists have no button of their own (Dividendi lost its Save on this propagation); what saves ITSELF says so in its footer (the colour theme, the light/dark mode), because a page that shows a Save button promises that everything on it waits for that button. **A control whose state does not exist yet renders no reading**: the light/dark mode is unknown until hydration, so its reading is dropped rather than guessed — the Narrative Honesty Rule applied to a fact the server cannot know.

**The Scheduled-Is-Not-Spent Rule** (Cashflow › Tracciamento and Analisi, 2026-08-28). A period is its WHOLE calendar span: «il 2026» is January → December even in August, because recurring series and instalments are materialised as real future-dated rows and a page does not hide what it holds. What has not happened yet is therefore inside the figures — and is **declared**: the verdict closes with how much, **how far**, and that the amount sits INSIDE the figure just printed («Nel totale ci sono ancora 450 € di spese già in calendario da qui a fine anno» — the bare existential form shipped until 2026-08-30 and was read as an addition; see the Don't in section 6), and that horizon is the end of the PERIOD, never of the last scheduled row, because the amount is bounded by the window the reader is looking at — «450 € entro ottobre» would be a different, smaller claim than the figure actually is. Where no end can be named (the whole history) the clause is dropped rather than guessed, the Narrative Honesty Rule again. Three corollaries. **A row that has not happened is marked wherever it is listed** — an «In calendario» chip in the feed, in the table and in the detail drawer, so a register can carry it without the list reading as a record of what was done. **A month that has not started is drawn lighter and never outlined**: the outline stays the month IN PROGRESS, which is partly real, while a month holding only recurring rows recedes rather than standing beside months that were lived. **A comparison is measured on the span the period covers** (2026-08-30). The delta printed beside a total measures the window that total covers: «Anno corrente» spans gen–dic, so its comparison is twelve months against twelve, not the eight already lived against eight — a percentage on gen–ago set beside a figure on gen–dic is taken by the reader as one comparison, which is the Same-Basis Rule. What is forbidden in either direction is twelve against eight: the two sides move together or not at all. The cost is real and is declared where it is paid — the current side's remaining months hold only what is already booked, so the delta is biased downward and the bias grows through the year, and it is the scheduled clause above that keeps it honest. Two things do NOT follow the period: a trailing history stays anchored to today, because history must not run into months nobody has lived, and «Da inizio anno» keeps its comparison on the months both sides share, its span already being the shorter one. That window did not disappear, it was NAMED: a period of its own beside «Quest'anno», with its own label («2026 · gen–ago», never the bare year) and its own subject («Nel 2026 finora»), so the reader chooses between two honest questions instead of being given one answer dressed as the other. It closes on the end of TODAY'S MONTH, not on today, so it carries scheduled rows too — a smaller forecast, never none.

This system explicitly rejects four aesthetic modes: Bloomberg terminal coldness (too dense and impersonal for a personal wealth journal), consumer fintech brightness (Revolut-style gradients and playful fills trivialize serious data), Material Design genericism (component conventions that serve any app therefore serve this one poorly), and **ostentated complexity** (UI that demonstrates how hard the domain is rather than hiding that complexity behind a calm surface).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Form follows function: every visual property is derived from what an element does — honesty over illusion, deference over decoration, inevitability over ornament
- Achromatic structural palette; data colors carry all chromatic meaning in the default theme
- Geist Sans for interface text, Geist Mono for every number that matters
- Radius is refined: 8px (`rounded-md` — inputs, buttons, badges, on the default theme), 16px (tiles, modals, the email card; fixed on every theme) — premium curve without losing authority
- Elevation is ambient: surfaces layer through background steps, shadows are atmospheric whispers
- Motion is physics-native: spring dialogs, ease-out-quart state transitions, circle-reveal theme toggle — and, since 2026-09-12, two authored moments that reveal a relationship rather than decorate: a navigation is one scene, a period transforms instead of being replaced (The Page Scene, The Period-Transforms Rule). Storico's scrub was the third and was retired on 2026-09-13, with the milestone confetti: the owner judged the page better still
- Hierarchy is Trade Republic-style: one dominant value per section, everything else is context
- Chrome reduction is deliberate: flat lists over nested cards, divide-y over borders-on-boxes
- Mobile-first: layouts are designed at 390px first; desktop adds columns, never simplifies
- Light and dark modes are equally premium — different materials, same quality standard
- Verdict first: every page opens with one rule-generated sentence that answers its question before any number is read — the prose is the hero, the figures inside it are mono and sign-coloured
- One tile, one question: a page is a 12-column grid of tiles, each naming its question (eyebrow), answering it in words (reading line), then showing the figures — no tile repeats another tile's rows
- Honest narratives: a sentence never claims what the data cannot support; a missing input drops its clause, it never prints a placeholder
- One eyebrow voice: the 10px/0.1em eyebrow names a tile's question, a page's section in the compact header, and a navigation group in the sidebar and the phone drawer — the frame and the content share one label register

### How this file is read by tooling

This document is the **normative** layer, in two parts: the YAML frontmatter (colors, typography,
`rounded`, spacing, components) is the machine-readable half, the prose below it is the human half,
and the two must always agree — a rule documented here but absent from the frontmatter reads as an
off-system value to any linter.

`.impeccable/design.json` is an **extensions-only sidecar**: tonal ramps, shadows, motion,
breakpoints, component HTML/CSS snippets, narrative. It never redefines a frontmatter token, and its
`narrative` is a verbatim mirror of this file — never paraphrase it, never let it carry a rule this
file lacks.

**Never regenerate this file.** It is hand-maintained and authoritative; CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md,
PRODUCT.md and the `doc/guide/*.md` files cite it. Extend the frontmatter additively when a real token
is missing, and refresh the sidecar on its own when the sidecar is what is stale.

## 2. Colors: The Zero-Chroma Foundation

The default palette has no hue anywhere. Every neutral is a pure OKLCH gray. Chart colors, financial indicators, and user-chosen themes supply all chromatic energy. The interface does not compete with the data it presents.

### Primary (Structural — Dark Mode)

- **Deep Void** (`oklch(0.145 0 0)`): The page background in dark mode. Zero chroma, minimum lightness. Numbers feel more precise against it than any tinted dark.
- **Charcoal Surface** (`oklch(0.205 0 0)`): Card and modal backgrounds. The first elevation step above the void.
- **Graphite Lift** (`oklch(0.269 0 0)`): Muted panels, secondary surfaces, hovered interactive backgrounds. The second elevation step.
- **Off-Blanc** (`oklch(0.985 0 0)`): Primary text in dark mode; page background in light mode. Near-white without the harshness of pure `oklch(1 0 0)`.
- **Near-White** (`oklch(1 0 0)`): Light mode card backgrounds and the lightest possible highlight. Used sparingly.

### Neutral

- **Mid-Ash** (`oklch(0.708 0 0)`): Secondary text, timestamps, supplementary labels. The workhorse of de-emphasis.
- **Subtle Ash** (`oklch(0.556 0 0)`): Placeholder text, disabled labels, tertiary metadata.
- **Border Ghost** (`oklch(1 0 0 / 10%)`): Card and container borders in dark mode. Near-invisible; enforces separation through barely-perceptible contrast rather than hard lines.
- **Border Stone** (`oklch(0.922 0 0)`): Card and input borders in light mode. Soft, unobtrusive.

### Data Visualization (Dark Mode Defaults)

Eight chart colors cover the semantic range of portfolio data — five from the beginning, three added on 2026-08-30 so that each of the eight asset classes owns a theme-aware hue instead of padding from a static tail. These are the system's only sanctioned source of hue in the default theme. Which class holds which slot is `ASSET_CLASS_CHART_INDEX`'s to say (`lib/utils/allocationUtils.ts`), and it is the ONLY place that says it: the hand-written class → `--chart-N` map in `lib/constants/colors.ts` was deleted on 2026-08-30 for putting crypto on `--chart-4` while the charts drew it on `--chart-3`, so one class wore two hues on one screen; `getAssetClassCssVar` is now derived from the index. What that file still holds (corrected 2026-09-06) is the older HEX map, `ASSET_CLASS_COLORS` (equity `#3B82F6`, …), exported as `getAssetClassColor` and read by one caller, `lib/services/chartService.ts:61`, as the Recharts fallback for a series that has not resolved its CSS variable yet — a theme-blind palette, declared in the DOM-side inventory below and not a second copy of the slot map. The attributions below follow that map; they are not a second copy of it either.

**These eight are the DARK palette (`.dark --chart-1..8`); the light palette holds the same hue bands since 2026-09-13.** Until then the light set — `:root --chart-1..8`, declared in the frontmatter as `chart-1-light` … `chart-8-light` — was a different set of eight (slot 1 an orange at hue 41, slot 2 a teal, slot 3 a deep petrol), which the 2026-09-06 note recorded as «in light mode “equities are indigo” is false». The Panoramica critique of 2026-09-13 measured what that cost on the real account: Liquidità and Immobili 10.1 ΔE00 apart (three of seven classes orange), Trend Following 16.2 from Obbligazioni, and the hero's rising curve painted in the hue of `--destructive`. Slots 1-5 were re-pitched onto the dark hue bands (blue · green · amber · violet · coral) with L and C set for a white surface, so what a slot means AND what it looks like are now stable across modes — on every email and every PDF too, which take the light palette through `PRINT_CHART_HEX` (**The Out-Of-DOM Token Rule**). The floor, ΔE00 ≥ 14 between any two slots of one mode, is a test (`__tests__/chartPaletteDistinctness.test.ts`) and holds for the default theme only: the five named themes are not measured by it (see Known Issues, CLAUDE.md).

- **Indigo Signal** (`oklch(0.488 0.243 264.376)`): Primary chart series; equities, main portfolio line. (It was also the sidebar's active-state colour through `--sidebar-primary` until the shell redesign of 2026-08-22; no component paints that token now — see Navigation.)
- **Jade Return** (`oklch(0.696 0.17 162.48)`): Secondary chart series; bonds, positive comparison benchmarks.
- **Amber Watch** (`oklch(0.769 0.188 70.08)`): Tertiary series; crypto. It paints no badge: a warning SURFACE takes `--warning` / `--warning-border` / `--warning-foreground` (below), never a chart slot.
- **Violet Risk** (`oklch(0.627 0.265 303.9)`): Quaternary series; real estate, drawdown overlays.
- **Coral Loss** (`oklch(0.645 0.246 16.439)`): Fifth series; negative returns, expense categories. Red-adjacent without alarm.
- **Antique Gold** (`oklch(0.660 0.135 100)`): Sixth series; Materie Prime.
- **Petrol Trend** (`oklch(0.720 0.115 215)`): Seventh series; Trend Following.
- **Rose Carry** (`oklch(0.700 0.190 340)`): Eighth series; Carry.

Slots 6-8 differ from the first five in one way, and it is deliberate: each holds its hue band between light and dark, re-pitching only L and C, because a slot that changed identity when the mode flipped would not be an identity. There is no ninth or tenth token — `useChartColors()` pads those two from the static `CHART_COLORS`, the last place a theme-independent hue can reach a chart.

### Semantic

- **Destructive Flame** (`oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)`): Destructive actions **and** the negative half of every sign colour. Saturated enough to demand attention without being an emergency siren. The five named themes each declare their own; seven of those twelve declarations were raised or lowered on 2026-08-13 to clear 4.5:1 as text against their own `--card` — the default theme already did and was left untouched.
- **Positive Jade** (`oklch(0.482 0.194 149.214)` light / `oklch(0.740 0.156 148.655)` dark): the positive half of every sign colour. **No named theme overrides it**, so one pair of values serves all twelve combinations. The light value was darkened from `0.627` on 2026-08-13: at that lightness it measured 2.62–3.22:1 across the light themes, so the reassuring half of every verdict read fainter than the alarming half — an asymmetry in what the interface was emphasising, not just a contrast number.
- **Warning surface** (`--warning` `oklch(0.986 0.022 90)` light / `oklch(0.260 0.038 78)` dark, `--warning-border` `oklch(0.855 0.062 85)` / `oklch(0.460 0.085 75)`, with `--warning-foreground` `oklch(0.468 0.098 75)` / `oklch(0.854 0.090 82)` as the text and the tone): the third tone of the verdict's full stop, the Budget Track's fill from 90%, the toast's rule, the «I risultati sopra usano i parametri dell'ultima esecuzione» line. A near-white fill with a faint hue, never a chart slot — declared in the frontmatter on 2026-09-06 after two propagations had used it undeclared.
- **AI accent** (`--ai-accent` `oklch(0.65 0.2 305)`, both modes): the one accent still declared in the chrome. It was the violet of the assistant banner; the banner went with the shell redesign and the token survives in exactly one place — the hover of the AI analysis button on Rendimenti (`app/dashboard/performance/page.tsx:220`: border, text and a 14px `color-mix` glow). Declared, not endorsed: the Zero-Chroma Rule is unchanged, and the next surface that wants a hue for «AI» does not get one.

### Named Rules

**The Zero-Chroma Rule.** The default surface palette has no hue. Adding a brand color to buttons, cards, or navigation in the default theme is forbidden. Color is earned by data, not decoration.

**The Data Owns Color Rule.** Chart palettes, performance indicators, and the five named themes are the only sanctioned sources of chromatic energy. Interface chrome in the default theme is always achromatic.

**The Sign-Color Token Rule.** Positive/negative *value* coloring (gain vs loss, income vs expense, up vs down deltas, variation chips, fiscal gains) always uses the theme-aware semantic tokens: `text-positive` for positive, `text-destructive` for negative, with `bg-positive/10` / `bg-destructive/10` for chip tints. Raw Tailwind `text-green-*` / `text-red-*` is forbidden here — those classes stay literal regardless of the active theme and diverge from `--destructive` on non-default themes (e.g. Cyberpunk renders destructive as orange), which would put two different "negative" colors on the same screen. `getMetricValueColor()` in `lib/utils/metricColors.ts` is the single source of truth for resolving the sign color. (Buy/sell *signal* chips — COMPRA/VENDI/OK — are a separate case, theme-mapped to the chart palette via `useActionColors`; see the ActionChip component.) **Time gates the sign as much as the number does** (2026-08-28): an amount dated after today takes NEITHER token but `text-muted-foreground`, because the sign tokens mean money gained and money lost and a scheduled row is not yet either — the rule holds wherever that row is printed (feed, table, detail drawer) and on the charts, where a month not started recedes instead of colouring (see **The Scheduled-Is-Not-Spent Rule**).

**The Out-Of-DOM Token Rule.** A surface with no cascade — a periodic email, the PDF export —
takes its colours from `lib/constants/printTokens.ts`, and from nowhere else. Every value there is
the sRGB rendering of a declaration in `app/globals.css`'s default theme, re-derivable by the
arithmetic its test pins (OKLCH → OKLab → linear sRGB → gamma), and a hex with no declaration
behind it does not belong in it. The rule exists because the alternative was tried for two years
and failed silently: with the literals written inline across twelve files, the emails ended up on
Tailwind's slate ramp (`#0f172a`, `#64748b`, `#94a3b8`) and the PDF on a `#3B82F6` accent, and
nothing in the codebase could notice. The named themes are deliberately NOT mirrored — an email is
read on a white card and a report is printed on white paper, so both take the default theme.

**Superseded, 2026-09-01** — the inline out-of-DOM palette: sign colours written as `#16a34a` /
`#dc2626` at each use site, greys from the slate ramp, and a blue accent on every PDF page title,
divider, table head and metric-card border.

**The DOM-side hex inventory** (declared 2026-09-06). «A hex lives only in `printTokens.ts`» is
true out of the DOM. Inside it, a literal hex is legitimate in exactly these places, each for a
reason a CSS variable cannot serve, and nowhere else:

- `lib/utils/cashflowSankey.ts` — the Sankey's node palette (twenty-one Tailwind-500 hexes): its
  hues are SEMANTIC (blue = fixed, violet = variable, amber = debt) and must not follow the chart
  slots, which would re-colour the meaning per theme. Since 2026-09-14 also its two label neutrals
  (`LABEL_TEXT_COLORS`, `#e5e5e5` dark / `#262626` light — the sRGB of the off-blanc and charcoal
  steps): a label is read, not coloured, and Nivo on react-spring cannot take a CSS token.
- `lib/constants/benchmarks.ts` — one hex per model portfolio (six): a benchmark's identity across
  Rendimenti and the email, not a series slot.
- `lib/constants/colors.ts` — `ASSET_CLASS_COLORS` (above) and `CHART_COLORS`, the static pad
  `useChartColors()` takes slots 9-10 from; both are the Recharts fallback and the last
  theme-independent hues a chart can reach.
- The Recharts `?? '#…'` fallbacks of Analisi's Dettaglio (`SavingsRateTrendSection.tsx`,
  `AndamentoStoricoSection.tsx`) and `AssetSparkline.tsx` (`#16a34a` / `#dc2626` — the retired
  out-of-DOM sign hexes, surviving as a pre-hydration fallback): read once, before the theme's
  slots have resolved.
- `lib/utils/costCenterColors.ts` — `LEGACY_HEX_SLOTS`, the legacy hex → slot migration map for
  documents that still hold a hex; and `components/expenses/CategoryManagementDialog.tsx`, whose
  hexes are the user's own category colours (a user-chosen colour is an identity, not a slot — see
  **The Selected-Row Rule**).
- Three payload hexes built server-side, where no cascade exists to read:
  `lib/services/dashboardOverviewService.ts:454,460` (the liquidity split) and
  `lib/services/chartService.ts:116` (the «altri» grey) — waived by name in
  `.impeccable/config.json`'s `ignoreValues`.

Everything else is debt, recorded here as fact and not as a fix. Two chrome hues of the default
theme violate **The Zero-Chroma Rule** today: `components/ui/switch.tsx:14` paints the dark ON
state `bg-blue-600` (because `--primary` is near-white there and a white pill on a white track is
invisible — the reason is real, the hue is still wrong), and `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx:43` draws
the auth spinner `border-gray-300 border-t-blue-600`. The third — an emerald Safari `mask-icon`
(`#10B981`) in `app/layout.tsx` for a brand that has no brand colour — was removed on 2026-09-13:
the tag is legacy (Safari reads the ordinary favicon since 2018) and the icon is multicolour, so it
never worked as a monochrome mask either. One sign-colour literal sits beside them:
`AssetSparkline.tsx:32`, listed above only because it is a fallback — the hexes it falls back to
are the ones the emails retired (the other, `ExpenseTable.tsx`'s `text-emerald-*` on an income
amount, went to `text-positive` on 2026-09-14, when the table's type badges also joined the feed's
dots and the hero's legend on ONE map, `lib/constants/expenseTypeColors.ts` — until then the
table said `income → --chart-1`, `fixed → --chart-2` while the legend 400px above said the
opposite, and the same green meant «Entrate» in one place and «Spese Fisse» in the other). None is
declared; a linter that flags them is right.

## 3. Typography

**UI Font:** Geist Sans (with `system-ui, sans-serif` fallback)
**Numeric Font:** Geist Mono (with `ui-monospace, monospace` fallback)

**Character:** Geist Sans is a neo-grotesque that reads precisely without clinical coldness. Its slightly geometric construction aligns with the Linear/Vercel reference. Geist Mono is not an afterthought: it is half the design system. Every monetary value, percentage, ratio, and structured date uses monospace figures — tabular numeral alignment is non-negotiable when columns of numbers must read as columns.

### Hierarchy

- **Display — Page Hero** (700 weight, `44px` mobile / `54px` desktop, lh implicit, ls `-0.03em`): The single dominant number on the page — net worth total on Overview. Always `font-mono tabular-nums`. In Tailwind: `text-[44px] font-bold font-mono tracking-[-0.03em] desktop:text-[54px]`. One instance per view maximum.
- **Display — Section Hero** (700 weight, `36px`, lh 1, ls `-0.03em`): Primary metric in a bento card or section hero block — e.g. TER, Annual Cost, FIRE Number. In Tailwind: `text-[36px] font-bold font-mono tabular-nums tracking-[-0.03em] leading-none`.
- **Sub-hero Value** (700 weight, `22px`, lh 1, ls `-0.025em`): Secondary metrics that sit below the dominant number or in paired value blocks — e.g. Liquid / Illiquid amounts, Entrate / Spese figures. In Tailwind: `text-[22px] font-bold font-mono tracking-[-0.025em] tabular-nums leading-none`.
- **Verdict Headline** (Geist Sans, 600 weight, `24px` mobile / `30px` desktop, lh 1.15, ls `-0.025em`): the page's opening sentence — the one place where prose, not a number, is the hero. In Tailwind: `text-[24px] font-semibold leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.025em] desktop:text-[30px]`. The trailing full stop is a separate span coloured by tone (see **The Verdict-First Rule**). The sentence under it is Body at `14px`/`15px` (`desktop:`), muted, with figures as mono `font-semibold` spans coloured by sign.
- **Compact Hero** (700 weight, `18px`, lh 1, ls `-0.03em`): the value of a secondary row inside a tile that already has its own hero — the second and third goals under the featured one. In Tailwind: `text-[18px] font-bold font-mono leading-none tracking-[-0.03em] tabular-nums`.
- **Headline** (600 weight, 1.25rem, lh 1.25, ls -0.01em): Section headers, dialog titles, card-level titles where data density demands authority.
- **Title** (600 weight, 1rem, lh 1.4, ls -0.005em): Sub-section headers, table group labels, the step below Headline.
- **Body** (400 weight, 0.875rem, lh 1.6): All prose, descriptions, note content. Max line length 65ch.
- **Reading Line** (Geist Sans, 400 weight, `13px`, lh 1.45): the one-line answer under a tile's eyebrow, before the figures. Figures inside it are `font-mono font-semibold tabular-nums` and take the sign colour; the prose stays `text-foreground`. Rendered by `NarrativeText` from a `Narrative` (segments with `mono`/`sign`), never assembled in JSX.
- **Label** (500 weight, 0.75rem, lh 1.4, ls +0.01em): Input labels, tags, stat captions, tab text. Slightly tracked for legibility at small sizes.
- **Eyebrow Label** (600 weight, `10px`, uppercase, ls `0.1em`, muted): Section eyebrow — the small all-caps label placed above a dominant number. In Tailwind: `text-[10px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.1em] text-muted-foreground`. Never competes with the number it names. It is also the compact page header's eyebrow and the group label of the sidebar and the phone drawer (`TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS` in `components/ui/tile.tsx`; on the sidebar surface its colour is `text-sidebar-foreground/60`) — see **The One-Eyebrow Rule**. Use 9px / `tracking-[0.08em]` for sub-eyebrows inside compact cells. Context can be appended with a centered-dot separator: `Cashflow · MAGGIO 2026` — the `·` joins without adding another label.
- **Delta Annotation** (Geist Mono, 400 weight, `12px`, ls 0): The small trend line that appears directly below a sub-hero value — under a figure of a tile's KPI trio (`CashflowKpiTrio`), under a run-rate figure of the Scheda; the KPI chip it was born in is superseded (Muted Sub-tile, Variant A) — e.g. `+5,2% vs mese scorso`. Always `font-mono`. Color follows sign semantics via the theme tokens (see **The Sign-Color Token Rule**): `text-positive` for positive, `text-destructive` for negative — never raw `text-green-*`/`text-red-*`. **Inverted semantics for expense metrics**: a positive delta on Spese is bad; parameter the color via `positiveGood: boolean`. In Tailwind: `text-[12px] font-mono mt-1.5 text-positive` (or `text-destructive`); prefer `getMetricValueColor()`. A neutral subline (non-trend) uses `text-[12px] text-muted-foreground mt-1.5`.
- **Numeric** (Geist Mono, 400 weight, 0.875rem, lh 1.4, `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1`): All monetary values, percentages, dates, quantities in financial contexts. Tabular figures always enabled.

### Named Rules

**The Mono Mandate.** Every number in a financial context uses Geist Mono with `tnum` features. No exceptions: KPI cards, table cells, chart axis labels, percentage badges. A number set in Geist Sans loses its financial authority. The ONE declared exception is the PDF export, which has no Geist to set it in — see **PDF Page and PDF Section**, where the column replaces the face.

**The Ramp Lives in the Frontmatter.** The enumerated step ladder — 9 / 9.5 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 / 14 / 15 / 16 / 17 / 18 / 20 / 22 / 24 / 30 / 32 / 36 / 40 / 44 / 54px, twenty steps, every one with at least one use in the tree (re-counted 2026-09-06; the workhorses are 13 and 11, four hundred uses each, and 17, 24 and 30 each live in ONE file: `PageHeader`, `page-verdict`) — is declared in `typography.scale`, because the named roles above cannot express a ramp, and this sentence and that list must name the SAME steps: until 2026-09-06 the prose enumerated twelve while the frontmatter held sixteen. Two consequences. First, the two layers of this file must agree: the prose documented the Trade Republic scale for months while the frontmatter still said `display: clamp(1.75rem, 3vw, 2.5rem)`, which made every documented hero size read as off-system (`display` is the 54px page hero since 2026-09-06). Second, a linter takes its font sizes **only** from the frontmatter (`typography` + `typography.scale`) — from `.impeccable/design.json` it takes only `colorMeta` and `typographyMeta`, the sidecar's two meta keys. So a `design-system-font-size` finding is never fixed by regenerating the sidecar, whatever the tool's own hint suggests; declare the size here instead. 32px and 40px sit in the ramp because they are genuinely used — they are the hero **overflow step-down** (`doc/guide/panoramica.md`, `resolveHeroValueClass`), not a step to reach for. Two sizes stay OUTSIDE it on purpose: `text-base md:text-sm` on every input (16px below `md:`, the iOS zoom guard — the field, not the ramp, decides), and shadcn's `text-[0.8rem]` weekday cells in the calendar and the period picker.

**The Two-Font Rule.** The system uses exactly two fonts. No display serif, no decorative typeface, no icon font treated as type. Hierarchy is expressed through scale and weight within the same two families.

**The Verdict-First Rule.** A page opens with a sentence, not a number. The headline states the verdict ("Agosto sta andando bene.", "Agosto è in calo: il mercato ha pesato.") and the sentence under it carries the facts with mono figures set inside the prose; only then comes the grid. The headline is Geist Sans 600 at 24px (30px from `desktop:`), the sentence 14/15px muted, both capped at `max-w-[920px]`. Tone is encoded ONLY in the colour of the headline's full stop (`text-positive` / `text-muted-foreground` / `text-warning-foreground` / `text-destructive`): colouring the whole headline would shout, and the figures already carry their own sign colours. The words come from rules in a pure module (`lib/utils/overviewNarrative.ts` for the Panoramica), never from a component: each phrasing is pinned by a test, and Italian grammar (gender and number of the subject, `a`/`ad` before a vowel month) is data in that module, not guessed at render.

**The Narrative Honesty Rule.** A generated sentence must never claim what the data cannot support. The canonical case: a month whose total fell while the market GAINED is not "il mercato ha pesato" — the cause is the user's own flows, and the headline says "nonostante il mercato". Corollaries: a missing input drops its clause (no prior snapshot → no monthly clause; no income → no savings clause; nothing attributable → no market driver) and never prints "N/D" or a placeholder; a figure that is a projection says so in the words next to it ("al ritmo attuale"); a list titled "per categoria" closes with the residual row ("Altre categorie") so it visibly adds up to the total it is a share of; and a digest labelled as return measures return — `Mercato:` is the price effect on what was held at the start of the period, never the user's buys and sells.

**The Declared-Window Rule.** A figure that is not measured over the window its surface is named
after must say so, in the surface's own scope line. The canonical case is the PDF's Cashflow
section: a "Totale" export floors the expenses at `cashflowHistoryStartYear` while Storico,
Rendimenti and FIRE stay unbounded, so a reader told "Totale" reads the missing years as years
without spending. The budget email is the second: it is sent weekly and contains nothing weekly,
so each tile names its window («dal 1° agosto a oggi», «da inizio anno a oggi») and the word
"settimana" appears once, to deny itself. A scope line is not decoration; it is the difference
between a number and a claim.

**The Comma Rule.** Every percentage the user reads is formatted for `it-IT` — `+1,01%`, `72,8%` — through chartService's `formatPercentage`, never `toFixed` (which prints `1.01%`, a dot the rest of the screen never uses). Currency comes from `cachedFormatCurrencyEUR`, which puts a no-break space before `€` and leaves four-digit amounts ungrouped (`4120,18 €`): tests flatten the nbsp and expect the real output. Signs are typographic: `+` and the true minus `−` (U+2212), never a hyphen. Rendimenti retired the last `toFixed` chips on 2026-08-25 (Patrimonio and Tracciamento theirs on 2026-08-22; a ratio such as «1,67×» or a Sharpe «1,08» goes through `formatNumber`, with the true minus swapped in). A sign is decided on the PRINTED figure: `−0,04%` prints as `0,0%`, unsigned and uncoloured, and a gap under a tenth of a point is «in linea». So is the ARTICLE in front of it: Italian takes «allo 0,1%», «all'8,5%», «al 12%» from the figure as printed and never from the underlying value, so the article is resolved by the shared helpers in the pure layer and never written by hand — «carry al 0,1%» reached the Panoramica because one sentence wrote «al » itself.

**The One-Eyebrow Rule.** The app has one eyebrow — `text-[10px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.1em]` — and it is the same element whether it names a tile's question, the section a compact page header belongs to ("PANORAMICA", "OPERATIVITÀ") or a navigation group ("ANALISI", "PIANIFICAZIONE") in the sidebar and the phone drawer. The 12px `tracking-widest` eyebrow of the legacy header and the 12px group labels the sidebar used to have were three sizes for one job; when the frame and the content use the same label, the frame stops reading as a second voice and the verdict is what the eye lands on.

## 4. Elevation

This system uses ambient depth: tonal background stepping combined with a consistent, low-opacity shadow vocabulary. Neither approach alone; both together.

Surfaces build depth first through background-value steps (Deep Void → Charcoal Surface → Graphite Lift), then layer shadow to signal function. A surface that floats above the page (modal, floating nav pill) gets a shadow that physically separates it. A surface that organizes content in place (card) gets a whisper shadow that barely catches light.

### Shadow Vocabulary

- **Whisper** (`box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`): Inputs, form fields. Barely perceptible — gives a field its "inset" quality without adding visual weight.
- **Lift** (`box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`): Cards, contained data panels. Separates a surface from the page without announcing itself.
- **Float** (`box-shadow: 0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.28)`): Floating elements that leave document flow — the mobile nav pill, dropdown menus, detached popovers. The one shadow that is large and felt. Reserved for elements that genuinely hover above the page.

### Named Rules

**The Ambient Rule.** Shadows here are atmospheric, not structural. A card's 1px border at 10% opacity does more compositional work than its shadow. Don't increase shadow size when a lighter border or a background-step change solves the separation problem.

**The Float Threshold.** The Float shadow is reserved for elements that physically exit the document flow. Using it on an in-flow card creates false depth hierarchy and is an error.

## 5. Components

### Page Verdict (Verdict-First Pattern)

The opening of every redesigned page: the verdict as a headline, the facts as a sentence, both generated by rules.

**Structure:**
```
[headline — text-[24px] desktop:text-[30px] font-semibold leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.025em], trailing "." in the tone colour]
[sentence — text-[14px] desktop:text-[15px] leading-[1.6] text-muted-foreground, figures as font-mono font-semibold spans with sign colour]
```
`max-w-[920px]`, `gap-2`, rendered by `PageVerdict` (`components/ui/page-verdict.tsx`, `ariaLabel` = what the verdict is about; `OverviewVerdict` is the Panoramica's thin wrapper) over the page's `build*Verdict()` — `buildOverviewVerdict()` in `lib/utils/overviewNarrative.ts`, `buildPatrimonioVerdict()` in `lib/utils/patrimonioNarrative.ts`. The `Narrative` segment type, `VerdictTone` and the `PageVerdictModel` every narrative module returns live in `lib/utils/narrative.ts`.

**Rules:**
- The words are a pure function of the payload, tested clause by clause; no component writes copy.
- Tone colours the full stop only: `positive` / `neutral` / `warning` / `negative` → `text-positive` / `text-muted-foreground` / `text-warning-foreground` / `text-destructive`.
- A missing input drops its clause; the sentence is never padded (The Narrative Honesty Rule).
- The page header above it is the compact `PageHeader` (the default since 2026-08-22, the only one since 2026-08-26 — there is no `variant` prop any more): the verdict IS the page title.
- A control that resets filters never resets the axis: «Ripristina» clears the Movimenti filters, the period is the picker's.
- A page whose question has an axis (Tracciamento's period) renders that control beside the verdict from `desktop:` — `flex items-start justify-between gap-6`, the verdict keeping its `max-w-[920px]` — and moves it under the verdict below that width (on Tracciamento, the period picker alone; the list filters go with the list — and since 2026-09-07 the Movimenti tile's mobile toolbar repeats the period picker beside them, a **second handle on the SAME state**, never a second axis: a search is read over a window, and with the only picker four tiles up, changing the window meant scrolling away from the answer). One axis governs the verdict AND every tile; a toolbar that narrows a list narrows only that list.

### Tile (One Question)

The unit of every redesigned page: `Tile` in `components/ui/tile.tsx` (the Panoramica's `OverviewTile` is a re-export of it, as are `NarrativeText` → `components/ui/narrative-text.tsx` and `RankedRows` → `components/ui/ranked-rows.tsx`). `TILE_CELL_CLASS` is the grid-cell wrapper.

**Structure:**
```tsx
<section className="flex min-w-0 flex-col rounded-2xl border border-border bg-card p-5 shadow-sm">
  <div className="flex items-baseline justify-between gap-3">
    {/* an <h3> under the verdict's <h2>: the class carries every metric */}
    <h3 className="text-[10px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.1em] text-muted-foreground">{eyebrow}</h3>
    <div className="shrink-0 text-[10px] text-muted-foreground">{aside}</div>
  </div>
  <NarrativeText segments={reading} className="mt-2 text-[13px] leading-[1.45] text-foreground" />
  {/* figures: KPIs at 22px, rows at 13px, 3px bars */}
  <div className="mt-auto border-t border-border pt-3.5">{/* secondary fact */}</div>
</section>
```

**Rules:**
- Eyebrow = the question; aside = its scope (a period, a count, "stima annua"); reading = the answer in words; figures after. Sub-labels inside the tile use the 9px sub-eyebrow.
- `p-5` (20px) and `gap-3` (12px) between tiles — tighter than the 22/16 of the previous bento; tiles are many and small.
- The dominant tile (net worth) spans two rows and lets its chart stretch (`relative flex-1 min-h-[180px]` with the SVG `absolute inset-0`); numbers and chips keep their size.
- No tile repeats another tile's rows (The One-Tile-One-Question Rule).
- The eyebrow is a heading (`<h3>`, 2026-09-20): a screen reader walks a long page by its headings, and a page of nine tiles listed two.
- The footer is ONE line. A method that needs more goes behind «Come si calcola» (`components/ui/tile-method-note.tsx`: a popover at a 40–50 character measure, its trigger named after the tile's subject). Storico's footnotes ran to nine lines at 95–130 characters: help that is always on stops being read, and reads as defensiveness.

### Tile Grid (12-Column Bento)

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-3 tablet:grid-cols-2 desktop:grid-cols-12">
  <div className="flex min-w-0 [&>section]:flex-1 tablet:col-span-2 desktop:col-span-5 desktop:row-span-2">…</div>
  <div className="flex min-w-0 [&>section]:flex-1 order-2 desktop:order-none desktop:col-span-3">…</div>
  …
</div>
```
Page root is `<PageContainer>` (`max-w-[1920px]`, the component's only width). **Superseded (2026-09-06)** — the 1600px container: the component's `default` width, `max-w-[1600px]`, was «the width of the pages not yet redesigned»; since the last propagation every one of the 33 call sites passed `wide`, so on 2026-09-06 the `width` prop and its branch were removed from `components/layout/PageContainer.tsx`. No page is 1600 wide, and no caller names a width.

On Allocazione: Bilanciamento 5 · Piano 7 / Per classe 6 · Esposizione 6 / Previdenza 12 (only with a pension fund), with a «Dettaglio» disclosure of two tiles (7 · 5) below the grid; the page has no axis, and its one control — the rebalance band — is the Bilanciamento tile's aside (The Scope-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule). On FIRE › Calcolatore: Traguardo 5 (2 rows) · Base di calcolo 3 (2 rows) · Reddito passivo 4 / Scenari 4, with a «Parametri» disclosure of two tiles (6 · 6) and a «Dettaglio» disclosure of three (6 · 6 / 12) below the grid; the page has no axis, and the Scenari | Ventaglio switch is the Traguardo tile's aside. On FIRE › Coast FIRE: Traguardo 5 (2 rows) · Afflussi 7 / Scenari 7, with an «Ipotesi» disclosure of four tiles (5 · 7 / 5 · 7) and a «Dettaglio» disclosure of four (6 · 6 / 12 / 12) below the grid; the page has no axis and no control of its own. On FIRE › What If: Prima e dopo 5 · Delta 3 · Evento 4 / Sensibilità 12, no disclosure; the page has no axis, its one control — the event form — is a tile of the grid, and on a phone the Evento comes first (The Input Tile Rule). On FIRE › Monte Carlo: Probabilità 5 · Distribuzione 4 · Scenari a confronto 3 / Parametri 12, with a «Dettaglio» disclosure of three tiles (6 · 6 / 12) below the grid; the page has no axis, and its one control — the plan — is a tile of the grid whose footer says whether the figures above still match what is typed (The Stale-Run Rule). On FIRE › Obiettivi: Obiettivi 5 (2 rows) · Traiettoria 7 / Milestone 4 · Allocazione derivata 3 / Assegnazioni 12 (Milestone takes 7 when the allocation is not goal-driven), with a «Dettaglio» disclosure of two tiles (12 / 12) below the grid; the page has no axis, and its one selection — the goal the Traiettoria draws — is a row of the Obiettivi tile (The Selected-Row Rule). On Previdenza: Il fondo oggi 5 (2 rows) · Rendimento 3 · Anno fiscale 4 / Versato nel {anno} 7 / Versamenti 12, with a «Dettaglio» disclosure of two tiles (6 · 6; the second takes 12 without a measured return) below the grid; the page's one axis — the fiscal year — sits beside the verdict and governs its two annual clauses and the three annual tiles, while the two tiles off it name their window in the aside (The Off-Axis Tile Rule). On Assistente the hero is `desktop:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]` — the one page that keeps it (The Conversation-Is-Content Rule): Conversazione (the composer sticky under it) | Patrimonio nel periodo (Patrimonio oggi for a free question) · Cashflow · Cosa sa di te as a sticky `self-start` column, with a «Come funziona» disclosure of three tiles (4 · 4 · 4) below the grid; the page's one axis — the period — sits beside the verdict. On Impostazioni — the one propagation with NO verdict (The Declaration-Tile Rule) — each tab is its own grid under the tab bar: Preferenze is Profilo 4 · Calcolo dei rendimenti 4 · Costi 4 / FIRE e obiettivi 4 · Parametri del piano 4 · Assistente 4 / Cashflow 5 · Famiglia 7 / Email periodiche 12; Allocazione is Allocazione target 5 · Auto-calcolo 7 / Target per classe 12 with a «Note e dettagli tecnici» disclosure below; Spese is Conti di default 5 · Import CSV 7 / Categorie 12; Dividendi is Entrate da dividendi 7 · BTP Italia 5; Condivisione is Condivisione account 7 · Come funziona 5; Aspetto is Modalità 4 · Tema colori 8. On the **landing pubblica**: Patrimonio 5 (2 righe) · Cashflow 4 · Composizione 3 / Obiettivi 7 / Rendimenti 4 · FIRE 4 · Previdenza 4, no disclosure — the first four tiles are the app's own, on an invented profile declared above the grid, and the last three carry no figures (The Sample-Data Rule). The verdict and the two actions sit above it, as on every other page; there is no axis, because there is no data to slice. **Accesso e Registrazione have no grid at all**: a 420px centred column (`w-full max-w-[420px]`, the page padded `px-4` so the tile is the phone's width less 16px a side) holding the eyebrow, the verdict, ONE tile and the secondary link — the one propagation where the twelve columns would have a single cell to place. A tile that may be absent (Costi, Obiettivi, Fuori scala, and the Assistente tile when the flag is off) hands its columns to its neighbour, or a hidden spacer closes the row. See **The Tile Grid Rule**.

### Modal (a Tile lifted off the page)

`ResponsiveModal` (`components/ui/responsive-modal.tsx`) — a bottom-sheet Drawer at ≤768px and a
centred Dialog above, one component so a surface cannot drift between the two widths.

**Structure (dialog):**
```
[eyebrow — TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS: «Nuova voce · Passo 1 di 2»]
[title   — text-[20px] font-semibold leading-[1.25] tracking-[-0.01em]]
[reading — ModalStatusLine: 13px/1.45, role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true",
           and Radix's Description through `asChild` — one node, not two]
──────────────────────────────── (a scroll edge, not a rule: the body scrolls under it)
[body   — px-6 py-5, fields in a two-column grid from sm:, sub-tiles on bg-muted]
────────────────────────────────
[footerNote (left, muted)]                          [Annulla (outline)] [primary]
```
`bg-card`, 1px `border-border`, `rounded-2xl`, the Float shadow. Header `px-6 pt-6 pb-4 pr-14`
(the close button is a 36px box at `top-4 right-4`); the drawer's header is `px-4 pb-3 pt-2` and
its footer stacks `flex-col-reverse` at `h-11`. The drawer is the one surface of the pair with its
own corners and no Float: `rounded-t-[10px]` on the top edge only, because a bottom sheet is cut by
the viewport and its separation is the scrim, not a shadow (`components/ui/drawer.tsx`).

**Widths** — `sm` 420 · `md` 560 · `lg` 720 · `xl` 960, and no others.

**Rules:** see **The Modal-Is-A-Tile Rule**. The words come from `lib/utils/dialogNarrative.ts`
(`describeModalStatus`, `describeWriteError`, the `describe*Intent`/`describe*Reading` builders),
never typed in a component; the destructive primary arms through `lib/hooks/useArmedDelete.ts`.

**Coverage (counted 2026-09-06, recounted 2026-09-14 evening; closed 2026-09-18).** 32 surfaces were `ResponsiveModal` on 2026-09-14 —
the vocabulary above. The thirtieth is `components/expenses/SeriesDeleteDialog.tsx`, the one question
a delete asks on a row of an instalment plan or a recurring series («solo questa o tutte?»), shared by
the Movimenti table and the tab, which each kept an `AlertDialog` for it until that day; the
thirty-first and thirty-second are Dividendi's «Scarica dividendi storici» confirm (`sm`, its reading
naming the instruments and the floor, then «Sto scaricando» for the whole run — the `AlertDialog` it
replaced closed on the click) and the per-year DPS figures of one row below `desktop:` (`sm`, a
drawer on a phone; it was a `Dialog max-w-xs` at 16px). A PLAIN row of the Movimenti table and a row
of the Dividendi table no longer open a modal at all: the delete arms in the row (`useArmedDelete`,
the row prints the consequence). **The vocabulary is total since 2026-09-18**: the four files that
still mounted the raw shadcn primitives — `DialogContent`'s own `sm:max-w-lg` (512px, a fifth width)
and `DialogTitle`'s 18px, neither on the ramp above — are `ResponsiveModal` now. The Panoramica's
snapshot confirm (`sm`, its title the ACT and the month: «Sovrascrivi lo snapshot di settembre», NOT
armed because the daily cron rewrites the running month anyway). The feed's detail
(`components/cashflow/TransactionFeed.tsx`, `sm`): it was three `Drawer`s with the confirm NESTED in
the detail, and it now arms in its footer while the reading gives way to the consequence in
`text-destructive` and says «Eliminazione annullata» when let go; a row of a series never arms — its
one confirmation is `SeriesDeleteDialog`, where it used to confirm twice. The Movimenti filters
(`MobileFiltersDrawer.tsx`, `sm`): the reading counts what is left («2 filtri attivi: restano 27
movimenti su 112.»), the primary names it («Mostra 27 movimenti», never «0 movimenti»), «Ripristina»
is the footer's secondary, and its five field names are form labels where they were a second
eyebrow. And the assistant's Conversazioni (`md`) and Memoria (`lg`) in
`components/assistant/AssistantModals.tsx`, two right-side `Sheet`s with a 14px title until then:
no footer (a list to pick from asks for no decision), the memory's tiles as `bg-muted` sub-tiles,
and the thread delete off its 3-second timer onto `useArmedDelete`. 40 mounts in 39 files
(`grep '<ResponsiveModal'`); the one raw primitive left is `components/layout/LogoutDialog.tsx`,
an `AlertDialog` on purpose because it interrupts.

### Compact Page Header

`PageHeader` — the compact header is the component, not a variant: the `variant` prop was deleted on 2026-08-26 (below). The one prop the compact form had no use for, `separator` — a no-op since the same date (`!separator && '-mb-0'`), still passed as `separator={false}` by eighteen callers that predated the deletion — was removed on 2026-09-06, from the interface and from every caller; the header has no separator prop, and nothing to pass. On `desktop:` one line — eyebrow (`TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS`, 10px/0.1em, the same as the tiles) · title (`text-sm font-medium`) · description (`text-sm text-muted-foreground`, joined with `·`) — actions right, `min-h-9`, no separator. Below `desktop:` the sticky navbar is unchanged (title 17px, description under it). The page's real headline is its verdict, so the header is a breadcrumb, not a title.

`variant="legacy"` — **superseded, and deleted on 2026-08-26 with Previdenza, the last page that declared it**: `PageHeader` has one variant. The pre-redesign desktop header (2xl/3xl title, description under it, optional `border-b`) survives only in `git log`.

**With section tabs** (Cashflow, FIRE e Simulazioni, Impostazioni): `PageTabBar` sits directly under the compact header row — from `desktop:` an underline bar of 13px `font-medium` tabs whose `border-b` is the header's only separator; below `desktop:` the segmented pill. The header keeps the page title, the tab keeps the section: no title is printed twice. Every tab carries `aria-label` unconditionally (the icon-only pill had no accessible name below 1440px) and the tablist is named after what it switches ("Sezioni di Cashflow").

### Tile Grid Skeleton

`components/ui/tile-grid-skeleton.tsx` — the ONE loading state of a redesigned page: the verdict's two muted lines, then the tile grid with the page's own spans (`cells: { span, rows?, lines? }[]`, class lookup in `lib/utils/tileGridSkeleton.ts`) and no numbers. It replaces the per-page skeleton components as each page is propagated; the Panoramica uses it with its default cells. Same root width as the page (`PageContainer`), so nothing jumps when the data lands. Every placeholder inside it is a `Skeleton` (`components/ui/skeleton.tsx`): `motion-safe:animate-pulse` — Tailwind's bare `animate-pulse` carries no reduced-motion guard, and until 2026-09-01 twenty-two surfaces breathed at a reader who had asked the OS for stillness — and `aria-hidden`, so the wait is announced once by the block's `role="status"` and not a dozen times by empty boxes.

### Empty State (nothing is recorded)

`components/ui/empty-state.tsx` — the absence in ONE sentence, rendered as the tile's reading line in `text-[13px] text-muted-foreground`, under the tile's own eyebrow, with at most one action (`mt-3.5`, a ghost button; a 44px full-width row below `desktop:`). No icon, no title, no centring: the tile keeps the height and the alignment it has when it answers, so the grid does not reflow when the data arrives. See **The Absence-Has-Three-Names Rule**.

**Superseded, 2026-09-01** — the illustrated empty state: a 64→104px monochrome SVG floating 6px on a perpetual loop, above a 14px title and a 12px description, centred in a block that dropped the eyebrow. It was the largest element of a tile carrying no information; the four hand-drawn icons that served it (`SeedlingIcon`, `CalendarEmptyIcon`, `ChartEmptyIcon`, `FilterEmptyIcon`) are deleted, the dropdown's 16px "no match" mark now being lucide's `SearchX`.

### Error Notice (the read failed)

`components/ui/error-notice.tsx` — a tile whose content is a failure. `role="alert"`, the tile's material (`bg-card`, 1px border, 16px radius, the Lift shadow) and the tile's anatomy, with the severity in the two elements that carry no figure:

```
[⚠ 16px, text-destructive]  [eyebrow — TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS in text-destructive: «Classi · lettura fallita»]
                            [message     — 13px/1.45, what was not read]
                            [reassurance — 11px muted, what was NOT touched]
──────────────────────────────────────────────
[Riprova (28px ghost)]  [footNote — the last successful read, or nothing]
```

Two placements, one component: at the **verdict's** place and width (`max-w-[920px]`) when a whole payload failed, or inside a **cell** when one query did — `TILE_CELL_CLASS` stretches it to the row like any tile. `compact` drops the reassurance for a cell of 4 columns or fewer; a wider cell keeps it. The words come from `describeReadFailure` (`lib/utils/statesNarrative.ts`), never typed in a component, and `canRetry`/`onRetry` travel together so no button is offered that does nothing. It supersedes `PensionErrorNotice`, `CostCenterErrorNotice` and the two inline copies on Patrimonio — one component written four times.

### Toast

`components/ui/sonner.tsx` — the surface stays `--popover`, as every dialog, dropdown and popover; the severity is the ICON and a 2px rule down the leading edge, both on the semantic token (`--positive` / `--warning-foreground` / `--destructive`). Title 13px/500, description 12px muted — the tile's own reading sizes, because a toast is a tile that leaves. Before 2026-09-01 Sonner painted every type identically and a `toast.error` differed from a `toast.success` by a 16px glyph alone. The WORDS of a failed write are `describeWriteError`'s, never an SDK string.

### Celebration Badge

`components/ui/SavingsRateBadge.tsx` — once per calendar month per account, bottom-left, on `bg-positive/10`. The `✦` is the one ornament in the system: typographic, not an emoji, and in one place only. The figure is `font-mono tabular-nums` like every other figure, and there is no exclamation mark — the product reports, it does not cheer. **`prefers-reduced-motion` governs the entrance and nothing else** (2026-09-01): it used to be a condition of the show decision, so a reader who asked the OS for stillness was never told their savings rate — reduced motion reduces the motion, not the content.

### Market Digest Line

The footer line of the net-worth tile: `Mercato:` followed by every asset class whose market price moved (on Patrimonio: the three instruments that moved the most, closed by an «altri» entry equal to the rest of the measured market effect — the same attribution before it is folded into classes, so the two pages never print the same line and three gains can never hide a negative total), largest effect first, as `{label} {±€}` pairs in a `flex flex-wrap gap-x-2` row (`·` between pairs, pairs `whitespace-nowrap` so a class never splits across lines). It measures return — the price effect on what was held at the start of the period — never the user's flows; pension funds get their own `Previdenza` entry (value net of the month's contributions); real estate is measured gross of debt. Hidden when nothing can be attributed, never shown as zeros.

### Ranked Rows with Residual

`components/dashboard/overview/RankedRows.tsx` — the CompositionList idea inside a tile: label · 3px bar (width = rank, the largest row fills the track) · mono amount · share. When the rows are a subset of a stated total, the list closes with a muted residual row (`Altre categorie`, no bar) so the shares visibly sum to 100% (The Narrative Honesty Rule). Bar colour is a chart slot (`var(--chart-1)` expenses, `var(--chart-2)` income), never a hex. A RECORD ranking is a different component (`components/hall-of-fame/RecordRows.tsx`): it carries a position, its value can be negative and its percentage is a variation rather than a slice, so it is not folded into this one — see **The Ranking-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule**.

**The ledger form** (Storico's Driver and «Lavoro e investimenti», 2026-09-20): when the rows are the PARTS of an identity — signed, some of them negative — there is no bar and no share, only label · signed mono amount, closed by a bold row for the total they add up to. A flow (savings, a mortgage repaid, a contribution) is signed and uncoloured, a gain or a loss follows its sign, a tax is always a loss. The printed rows add up to the printed total to the euro: every row is rounded to the printed unit and the remainder row («Altre variazioni») carries the drift, because a reader who adds the rows by hand is exactly the reader this form is for. Six signed figures in one sentence is the pattern this replaces.

### Table inside a Tile (Strumenti)

The management table of Patrimonio keeps being a table — sortable columns (the three Δ windows included), the «Andamento» VIEW, the optional grouping by class, the `--chart-3` tint on hand-priced rows, the two-click delete without a timer (`useArmedDelete`, one live region per tile) — but it lives inside a tile and takes its cadence: eyebrow (`Strumenti`), the toggles as the aside (`h-8`, 11px outline buttons, `aria-pressed`, remembered per browser), a reading line («16 strumenti, 2 valutati a mano; i 3 maggiori pesano il 39,3%»), then the rows. Column headers are the 9px sub-eyebrow (`TILE_SUB_EYEBROW_CLASS`, `scope="col"`; a sortable one carries `aria-sort` and a `<button>` inside, never a focusable `<th>`), the actions header is named for a screen reader only («Azioni sulla riga» — a visible «AZIONI» sat over a column of «Azioni» class chips), cells are 13px with every number `font-mono tabular-nums`, rows separate with a 1px `border-border` and nothing else, and the first cell of each row is a `<th scope="row">` whose sub-line says what the storage does not: a bond's maturity and next coupon («scade il 10/03/2032 · prossima cedola 10/12»), a hand-valued holding's «valore a mano dal 12/08» with «—» in Quantità · Prezzo · PMC (its value lives in `quantity` at price 1, and a PMC equal to the price is not a PMC). «Andamento» replaces Quantità · Prezzo · PMC · TER with the three Δ windows — a view, not four more columns — so the table fits the tile at 1440 in both states and never scrolls the page; should it ever scroll (its own `overflow-x-auto` wrapper, `-mx-5 px-5`), the actions column is `sticky right-0` on the card surface with a 1px left rule only while it does. A muted footer pinned with `mt-auto` explains the tint and, per state, what the columns are (2026-09-14).

Below `desktop:` the same rows are a flat `divide-y` list of expandable rows (`AssetRow`): name · class chip · value · G/P on the closed row (the sub-line under the chip), and on open — the CSS `grid-rows-[0fr] → [1fr]` technique with `inert` on the closed panel — the details grid, the unit-price sparkline (`role="img"`, named, out of the tab order), the three Δ windows and the actions as `h-11` (44px) outline buttons in a two-column grid. A card per row would be a card inside the tile (the old `AssetCard` was one), so the rows are flat on purpose.

### Feed inside a Tile (Movimenti)

The transaction feed of Tracciamento stays the inventory it is — day groups, flat rows, the detail as a `sm` modal whose delete arms in its footer, the dense `ExpenseTable` behind a «Feed | Tabella» switch — but it lives inside a tile and takes its cadence: eyebrow (`Movimenti`), the count as the aside («47 voci», or «12 di 47 voci» while the toolbar narrows the list), a reading line that counts the rows by type and names the largest («47 movimenti: 40 spese, 5 entrate e 2 trasferimenti; la voce più grande è Stipendio (4200 €)»), then the toolbar (search, categories, subcategory, account, sort on the left; the view switch and «Esporta CSV» on the right, `ml-auto`) and the rows. The feed keeps `surface="flat"` on every width — a card per day inside a tile would be a card inside a card — and the toolbar is `hidden desktop:block`: below that width the `[periodo · Filtri · ordina]` bar of `MobileFiltersDrawer` renders inside the tile (`mobileToolbar`, `desktop:hidden`) — next to the list it narrows — and its period picker is the SAME `period` the picker under the verdict drives (a second handle, its own accessible name «Periodo dei movimenti», `min-w-0` so the picker yields before the buttons when a phone runs out of room; `e2e/cashflow.mobile.spec.ts` pins the fit at 390 and 360). **The toolbar narrows only this tile**: the verdict and the other tiles read the period slice, never the filtered list, because a savings rate computed over one category is not a savings rate.

### In-tile Bars (hand-written SVG)

A small bar chart inside a tile — income beside spending per month on Tracciamento's hero, the savings rate per month on «Risparmio nel tempo», net dividend income per month AND per year on Dividendi (one component, `NetIncomeBars`, two windows: a second implementation of the same quantity would drift) — is a hand-written `<svg viewBox preserveAspectRatio="none">` of `<rect>`s positioned `absolute inset-0` inside a `relative flex-1` box with a `minHeight` (the sparkline's stretch technique), never Recharts: the bars stretch with the tile's free height and nothing else on the page pays for a chart library. Three rules. The **axis labels live outside the SVG**, in a CSS grid with as many columns as bars (`font-mono text-[10px]`), so they never stretch with the plot. **Colour is the chart slot the rest of the page already uses for that quantity** — `--chart-2` for income, `--chart-1` for spending, the same two the category tiles' bars take — and a month below zero is `--destructive` drawn under the baseline. **A reference line is a dashed `--foreground` at 60% and carries no label**: the reading line above the chart says what it is («In media il 31%»), and a label on the plot would paint over whichever bar stands at the edge. **The month the page is about is outlined** (`stroke="var(--foreground)"`, `vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke"`) and its axis label set `font-semibold` — never the other months dimmed, since a dimmed slot falls under the 3:1 floor for graphical objects on the light card. **A baseline series is a neutral, and an unknowable baseline is a gap** (Analisi, 2026-08-25): the previous year's same month stands beside the current bar in `--muted-foreground` — neither the gain nor the loss colour, because a baseline is neither — and a month whose baseline cannot be known (below the history floor, or a previous year with no rows at all) draws nothing there, never a flat zero that would read as «spent nothing»; the footer under the chart says which of the two it is. **A window still RUNNING is drawn at reduced fill AND outlined** (Dividendi's current year): it is real data the reader must see, and it is not comparable with the closed ones the reading ranks — the outline says «this one is different», the reduced fill says «not yet finished», and the footer says which; every `<g>` carries a `<title>` with the month's figures, the native tooltip. **With a mouse, the plot reads the point under it** (`components/ui/chart-hover.tsx`: `useChartHover` snaps to the slot of a bar chart or the nearest point of a line, `ChartHoverTip` is the small `bg-popover` card at the top of the plot, centred on the anchor and kept inside it at the edges, figures mono and sign-coloured; a hovered slot is washed with `--foreground` at 6%, a hovered sparkline point gets a dot and a 25% guide line). It mounts only under `(pointer: fine)`: on a phone or a tablet the chart stays a shape and the `<title>`/`aria-label` carry the figures — the same reading exists for the net-worth sparkline of the Panoramica and Patrimonio (`NetWorthSparkline interactive`). The SVG carries `role="img"` and an `aria-label` that lists every month's figures, so the chart reads as a sentence to a screen reader; the legend swatches (`rounded-[2px]`, 8px) are `aria-hidden`. **A histogram is the same shape with bins for months** (`components/ui/histogram-bars.tsx`, 2026-09-24, the one component under the Monte Carlo's final values, the FIRE year and the ruin year of the paths — `year-bars.tsx` names the year bins): the reference bin outlined, and a bin that is not a value of the quantity (the paths past the horizon, «oltre») in the muted ink rather than the series' slot, so a state never wears the colour of a measure.

### Tick under a Row (Per classe)

Every class, sub-category and — without a tick — theoretical target of Allocazione's Per classe tile is ONE line: name and `ActionChip`, then three right-aligned mono columns (current share at 13px, target share at 11px muted, the gap in euro in the action hue, signed with the operation: `+` there is too much, `−` something is missing), then a 14px chevron or its footprint so the columns never shift between a class that opens and a leaf — and under it the 3px `TargetTick`: the fill is the current weight in `--chart-1`, the 1px `--foreground/70` marker sticking 3px above and below is the target, on a per-row scale (`max(current, target) × 1.12`) so a tiny sleeve still reads. The name block has a 140px basis and the columns `ml-auto`: below that room (a 390px phone) the figures drop to a second line, right-aligned, instead of squeezing the name to an ellipsis. The old row — a dominant euro value, a micro line and a 6px bar — was right for a page whose composition WAS the page; inside a tile six classes and their sub-categories must read as one list. First applied on Allocazione, 2026-08-25.

### Budget Track (the 3px bar with today's mark)

Every budget row of Cashflow › Budget — the ceiling's hero, the annual budgets, the per-category list — is a 3px track whose fill is what is used and whose 1px `--muted-foreground` mark is **today on the window** (day / days in month for a monthly budget, day of year / days in year for an annual one): «73% used at 71% of the month» is legible at a glance only because the two are drawn on the same track, and the reading line says the same in points («2 punti avanti rispetto al calendario»). `BudgetTrack` (`components/cashflow/budget/BudgetTrack.tsx`) is the one component; an income target carries no mark (a salary lands once, the calendar says nothing about it). **The comparison with the calendar reads what is BOOKED, and the ceiling's track carries two fills** (2026-09-14): the rows dated after today are a second, lighter segment of the same colour after the booked one, the hero prints `spentToDate` over «speso» with «+ 1297 € in calendario» beside it, and the reading compares only the booked share («Hai speso il 22% del tetto al 47% del mese: 25 punti indietro …; con le spese in calendario sei al 65%») — the Scheduled-Is-Not-Spent Rule applied to the one page that still folded a mortgage due on the 27th into «hai usato il 65%». The same calendar governs the Avvisi rows: a crossed quota threshold is painted `--warning-foreground` only when its share is ahead of the calendar of its OWN window («soglia 50% · anno al 70%» stays muted), the thresholds count booked spend only, and an annual row names its window («da gennaio»). A screen reader hears the track's real share through `aria-valuetext` («231%, oltre di 1963 €»), never the clamped 100. Fill colour follows the budget, not the sign tokens: `--foreground` while under the limit (a budget under its limit is not a gain), `--warning-foreground` from 90%, `--destructive` over it; an income target is muted until reached and `--positive` then (`budgetProgressStyle.ts`). The `h-1.5` bars of the old budget list retired with it (2026-08-23). On the hero's six-month bars the ceiling is drawn **per month** — one dashed segment at the ceiling that month HAD (the daily cron records it in `budgetHistory/{uid}/months/{YYYY-MM}`), a step where it changed — and the caption names whose ceiling each month is read against; once the ceiling is crossed, the KPIs change face: «Restano / Al giorno per restare nel tetto» becomes «Oltre, dal 22 / spesi al giorno · il tetto ne regge 65», and the verdict says WHEN («Lo hai superato il 22; …», «…, superando il tetto il 29»).

### Scheda inside the Grid (Analisi)

The focused entity of Analisi — a category, or one of its subcategories — is a tile of the grid, not a mode of another tile: a 12-column «Scheda · {name}» that appears under the two category tiles the moment a row, an anomaly, a top expense, a Sankey node, the search or a Confronto row selects an entity (ONE landing path, `handleEntitySelect`), and that the page scrolls to. Its head carries the breadcrumb («Spese › Casa › Condominio», every step but the last a link), the type and the history floor as the aside, and the two actions — «Indietro» (one level) and «Chiudi» — as 32px ghost buttons from `desktop:` (the dense floor; they were 28px until 2026-09-14) and a full-width row of 44px outline buttons below it; its reading states the period total, its share of the parent and of the period, the newest year's delta on the like-for-like window and the pace («Nel 2026 hai speso 1200 € in Condominio, l'11,5% di Casa e il 3,8% delle spese; +8,1% sugli stessi mesi del 2025, al ritmo di 150 € al mese.»); its body is the `EntityDossier` in two columns from `desktop:` — the period total, the run-rate chips and the per-year table on the left; the 24-month trend and, under it, the period's subcategory ranking (category level) or its transactions (subcategory level) on the right, as flat rows below `desktop:` and a table with the sub-eyebrow as its header from it. Inside the Scheda the run-rate figures are flat KPIs (sub-eyebrow · 18px · caption), never tinted sub-cards — a card inside a tile is a card inside a card — and every aggregate of the Scheda is whole euros like the rest of the page (since 2026-09-14; cents stay on the transaction rows, which are facts, not sums); the pace is the lived total over the months lived, its chip says «sui primi 9 mesi», and the projection's caption says «calendario incluso». The «Confronto annuale» tile below the grid draws the comparison year as the same neutral baseline the Periodo tile uses, and its view switch is the aside's 11px toggle (`AsideToggle`: `h-7` from `desktop:`, 44px below), the Strumenti form — a 14px pill in the 10px aside slot read as a second control register. The category tiles keep their place and their rows while the Scheda is open — the focused row is `aria-current` and its tile unfolds past «Mostra tutte» if the row is hidden there — so the reader can move to a sibling without closing anything. The focus lives in the URL (`?focusType&focusCat&focusSub`) and survives a period change: the per-year table and the trend ignore the axis on purpose, the total and the transactions follow it, and every block names its window.

### Heatmap inside a Tile (Consistenza)

The monthly-returns heatmap of Rendimenti is a `<table>` — years are rows, months are columns, `scope` on both headers — whose cells carry no figure: at a tile's width twelve columns leave no room for «+1,2%», so the figure lives in the cell's `title`, in an `sr-only` span and, with a mouse, in the same `ChartHoverTip` the in-tile charts use (positioned from the hovered cell's rect). The fill is the sign token at three intensities — `color-mix(in oklab, var(--positive) 30 | 55 | 85%, transparent)` inline on the cells (`heatmapCellStyle`, so a cell can cross-fade to its next colour), the same steps as `bg-positive/30 · /55 · /85` utilities on the legend's swatches — so the map follows the theme like every other gain and loss (the raw `bg-red-*`/`bg-green-*` it had stayed literal on Cyberpunk, where the negative colour is orange); a flat month and a month out of the period are the muted surface, neither a gain nor a loss. Because no text sits on the fills, the AA text floor does not apply to them. The legend (six swatches and «fuori periodo», `rounded-[2px]` colour keys) is pinned above the footer with `mt-auto`, so the row's slack sits between the grid and the legend rather than under it.

### Growth of 100 inside a Tile (Rendimento)

The Rendimento tile's plot is the portfolio and the reference model compounded from 100 over the measured window, hand-written like the in-tile bars (`preserveAspectRatio="none"`, labels outside the SVG, a hover reading under `(pointer: fine)`), with an explicit base point at 100 — a series that starts at `100 × (1 + r₁)` hides its first month — and the 100 line dashed in `--foreground` at 60%. **The model is a baseline and takes `--muted-foreground`**, never a series colour: a coloured benchmark would compete with the one line the tile is about, and the neutral-baseline rule of Analisi's bars applies to a line as it does to a bar. A gap in the model's series (the running month, a feed that ends earlier) is a gap in the line, never a flat 100.

**The Period-Transforms Rule (2026-09-12).** When the axis of a page moves, the tiles TRANSFORM into the new window; they are never unmounted and redrawn. A figure glides from the one it showed (`useCountUp({ fromPrevious })`, 620 ms ease-out-quart), a hand-written series glides index by index after the old one is resampled onto the new length (`lib/utils/seriesMorph.ts` + `useMorphingSeries`, 420 ms, the y-scale travelling with it), a heatmap fades cell by cell (300 ms on an inline fill) and its rows enter or leave on a 220 ms fade, ranked rows re-rank in place on the 400/35 spring and their bars slide to the new width. The glide is the ONLY frame that is not a measurement, and it says so by construction: the hover, the `aria-label` and every printed figure read the landed data, never the frame. A refresh that re-reads the data still dims the grid while it waits — that is a wait, not a change of window. Reduced motion jumps. First on Rendimenti: `key={periodRenderKey}` on the grid, which remounted every tile on a period switch, went with the rule.

**Rule — a Δ is a unit-price variation.** The three windows (Mese, YTD, Inizio) measure the canonical EUR unit price `totalValue / quantity` of the snapshot against today's, gross of debt for the hand-valued property (by type, never by class), never the position's total value: a purchase never moves a Δ, and a snapshot taken this month is no base for any window. Pension funds and cash accounts, whose quantity IS the value, print `—` (`lib/utils/assetPerformanceDeltas.ts`).

**The One-Tile-One-Question Rule.** A tile answers exactly one question, and its anatomy is fixed: eyebrow (the question, 10px uppercase), optional aside (scope or period, 10px muted, right), reading line (the answer in words, 13px/1.45 with mono figures), then the figures, and optionally a footer pinned to the bottom with `mt-auto` + `border-t` for the secondary fact. Two rows that say the same thing never appear in two tiles — when "Spese per categoria" exists, the Cashflow tile shows the month's pace and last month's figure instead of the same top-3. The shell is one component (`OverviewTile`): the app's card (`bg-card`, 1px `border-border`, 16px radius, Lift shadow, 20px padding) as a naked `section` so the tile owns its flex column. Inside a tile, chrome stays flat: `divide-y` rows, 3px bars, no sub-cards.

**The Tile Grid Rule.** Pages are laid out on a 12-column grid with explicit spans (`grid-cols-1 tablet:grid-cols-2 desktop:grid-cols-12`, `gap-3`), the dominant tile spanning two rows (`desktop:col-span-5 desktop:row-span-2`), and the page root at `max-w-[1920px]` — a bento uses width, and at 1600px a 27" monitor left a third of the main area empty. Every grid cell wraps its tile in `flex min-w-0 [&>section]:flex-1` so tiles stretch to their row and `mt-auto` footers align across a row. Below `desktop:` the grid collapses and the reading order is set explicitly with `order-*` (the month's cashflow before the wealth split on a phone). Scrolling is allowed by design: density is a feature, "everything in one screen" is not a rule — the third row lives below the fold at 1440×900.

**The Hover Reading Rule.** A hand-written chart (the in-tile bars, the net-worth sparkline) names the point under the mouse — month and figures, mono and sign-coloured — through ONE primitive, `components/ui/chart-hover.tsx` (`useChartHover` for the index, `ChartHoverTip` for the card), and only under `(pointer: fine)`: a phone or a tablet never mounts the overlay, the chart stays a shape there, and the figures stay where they already are — the reading line, the `<title>` of each month, the `aria-label` of the plot. The tip is HTML positioned against the plot box, never an SVG element (a `preserveAspectRatio="none"` plot would stretch it), and carries no interaction of its own (`pointer-events-none`): it reads, it never offers an action. Recharts charts keep their own tooltip; this rule is for the charts the pages draw by hand.

**The Scrub Rule — retired (2026-09-12 → 2026-09-13).** For one day Storico's Evoluzione series was the page's month axis under a fine pointer (the head value gliding onto the month, Composizione re-ranking, the Driver slot lighting). The owner removed it: on an axis-less page the pointer must not turn every tile into a mode, and a hover stays a reading of the chart it is on (The Hover Reading Rule). Do not reintroduce it; the mechanism (`onMouseMove` → `activeTooltipIndex`, a pure resolver) stays described in AGENTS.md → Recharts should another page ever earn it.

**The Grouped Chip Rule.** Inside a tile, same-purpose chips (monthly change, yearly change, record) sit in ONE grouped row from `tablet:` up — `flex flex-wrap items-start gap-x-2.5 gap-y-2`, each chip `w-fit whitespace-nowrap` with its caption under it — and stack in a column on phones. This supersedes the Equal-Column Chip Rule for hero tiles: equal grid columns made two chips sit a tile-width apart, which read as two unrelated facts. The equal-column grid remains correct for full-width chip rows outside a tile.

**The Received-vs-Announced Rule.** Where a surface shows money that has arrived beside money that
has only been announced, the two are never one figure and never one colour. The received half keeps
the sign colour and its own total; the announced half is muted, badged («Attesa»), and totalled
separately — two `tfoot` rows, two subtotals in a dialog, its own chip beside the hero, its own
clause in the reading («12 incassate (1484 €) e 3 annunciate (277 €)»). A single grand total is
forbidden however convenient: it tells the reader they have what they do not. First applied on
Dividendi, where the calendar, the table, the day dialog, the hero and the leaderboard footer each
draw the line in their own material. The announced half is also **on the page's own window**: it is
bounded by the period exactly like the received half, upper bound at the end of the period's unit
rather than at today. An unscoped total beside a scoped one is two windows in one tile — the first
cut of Dividendi printed «127 €» of announced money next to a list holding one 57 € coupon, and put
a final premium dated 2032 in the list for August.

**The Off-Axis Tile Rule.** A page has ONE axis, and a tile whose figures are NOT on it must say so
rather than appear to follow. Dividendi's Rendimento tile is measured on the trailing twelve months
of the current holding whatever the picker says, so its aside reads «ultimi 12 mesi» and its footer
spells the base out — the coverage, and that the window does not follow the period. This is the
tile-level form of a rule first stated on Centri di Costo while it still had an axis: *a surface
that shows a period must be able to change it, or must name the window of every figure that uses a
different one.* Never "fix" it by wiring the axis into a figure the axis cannot honestly move.

**The Whole-Cost Corollary** (Centri di Costo, 2026-08-23). A page may have NO axis at all when
its question has none: a project's cost is its whole cost, so Centri di Costo dropped its
Mese|Anno|12 mesi|Sempre picker and reads everything «in totale». The rule then inverts — every
figure is lifetime unless it says otherwise, and the ones that use a window carry it in their own
words: «quest'anno», «anno scorso», «ultimi 12 mesi», «Tetto mensile · agosto» with today's mark,
«Questo mese» and «Quest'anno» with the calendar in their caption («con il calendario chiude a
1100 €»). A delta against "the previous period" has no honest predecessor without an axis, so it
is gone rather than faked. **A center has no pace** (2026-09-18): until then the two cells were
«Fine mese» / «Fine anno» «al ritmo attuale», and a 1650 € repair on the 17th read «~2942 € a fine
mese». A project spends in blocks, and its recurring series are already real future rows, so a
window's end is what is booked plus what is in the calendar — a sum, printed without «~».

**The Risk-vs-Fact Rule.** A projected overrun and a crossed threshold are two different things
and never sit in the same tile. «Categorie a rischio» lists the monthly budgets whose month-end
projection exceeds their amount — money not yet spent, named as a projection («a fine mese», «al
ritmo attuale») — and a budget ALREADY over is not there: it is a fact, and facts belong to
«Avvisi» («Superato», with the threshold it crossed). The alert evaluator still fires a
forecast-only alert for the email, but the tile filters it out (`thresholdCrossed`), so no row
appears twice. On Centri di Costo the same two names stand on the CALENDAR, not on a pace
(2026-09-18): a ceiling crossed by what is booked is the fact, one still holding that the rows
already dated ahead carry past it is the risk («supererà il tetto», «con le spese già in
calendario») — and the risk outranks dormancy in a center's verdict, or the list and the detail
answer differently about one center. Corollary on the projection itself: it is the app's ONE rule (the pace on what is
booked to date plus the rows already in the calendar — Tracciamento's and the Panoramica's), and a
FIXED or debt category never follows the pace: rent paid on the 1st, extrapolated by the day, would
read «at risk» all month. First applied on Budget, 2026-08-23.

**The Same-Basis Rule** (Rendimenti, 2026-08-25). A gap printed beside a figure is on that figure's basis. Below a YEAR the hero states the PERIOD return («+2,1% nei 4 mesi» — six months until 2026-09-20, when a nine-month year-to-date still printed «+16,0%» at 54px over a measured +11,8%; the rate per year is the companion chip from six months on), so the «0,4 punti sopra il Portafoglio 60/40» next to it — in the verdict AND in the tile's chip, one function — de-annualises both rates to the same four months — the annualised gap (1,2 points) beside a period figure told the reader the model made a third of what it made. Corollaries: the subject of the verdict names the window actually MEASURED («Negli ultimi 11 mesi» on eleven snapshots, «Da aprile» on a year-to-date that starts there), never the picker's label; «oggi» is said only when the window closes on the latest snapshot, otherwise the closing month is named («a fine dicembre 2024»); and two sentences on one page decide a tie the same way — a gap under a tenth of a point is «in linea» in the verdict and «alla pari» in the Benchmark tile, counted neither as beaten nor as above.

**The One-Pace Corollary** (Storico, 2026-08-25). A page that projects has ONE pace, and every sentence that judges speed uses it. Storico's pace is the average monthly increase of the last twelve months, in euro — linear on purpose: wealth growth is contributions plus returns, and a compound extrapolation of a saver's contributions is a forecast dressed as a measurement — and it decides both the verdict («sta accelerando» against the lifetime monthly average; within ±10% it is «al ritmo di sempre», below it «ha rallentato», negative «nell'ultimo anno ha perso») and the Raddoppi tile's «prossimo raddoppio … a gennaio 2028». Two guards keep it honest: below two years of history no pace is judged (the trailing year overlaps most of the history), and a target more than fifty years away at that pace has no date. A growth rate that includes contributions is always named as such («il 19,4% l'anno, versamenti inclusi»), so it can never be read as Rendimenti's return; the verdict names the best month and the Evoluzione tile the worst, never the same figure twice. Two corollaries on the same page: a running year is measured from its real baseline («Da aprile 2026» when the history starts in March, never a hardcoded «gennaio»), and a quantity effect — a buy, a sell, a deposit landing on a cash account — is a flow, set in mono with a typographic sign and NO colour, because the sign tokens mean gain and loss and nothing else.

**The Scope-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule** (Allocazione, 2026-08-25). A control that changes how the figures are CLASSIFIED but not what is MEASURED is a scope, not an axis. Allocazione's rebalance band (±2% · ±5% · 5/25 · custom) turns a class into COMPRA, VENDI or OK and leaves the balance score, the misallocation and every euro figure exactly where they were, so it sits in the aside of the tile whose reading it qualifies — Bilanciamento — never beside the verdict, and that tile keeps the measurement it does not move (the ring, «3,7% fuori posizione») beside the classification it does («2 classi su 5 fuori target», the chips). Three corollaries. **The verdict's actionable clause reads ONE fixed answer** — «con 1000 € in più compreresti 856 € di obbligazioni…», the Versa split at the Piano's amount — whatever mode that tile shows: a verdict that followed a tile's toggle would be that tile's title, not the page's. **A drift is neither a gain nor a loss**: no figure of the page wears a sign token; the action hues (COMPRA / VENDI / OK through `useActionColors`, resolved once per tile) colour the chips, the plan amounts and the ring, and the prose stays `text-foreground`. **A Σdrift is a leverage gap only when leverage is in play**: without a leveraged holding or target, a negative sum is wealth in classes the targets do not name, and the sentence names them («il 78% è in classi senza target (Immobili, Liquidità)») instead of calling a house «esposizione sotto il target di leva».

**The Ranking-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule** (Hall of Fame, 2026-08-25). A record is a POSITION, not a period, so a page whose question is «which were the best?» has no axis — and the control that chooses WHAT is ranked is not one either. On the grid every ranking is already a tile with its own question, so a `Mensile|Annuale` + `Crescita|Calo|Entrate|Spese` switcher over them would answer the same question twice; it belongs to the disclosure that holds the full table, as that tile's aside, where it governs one thing. Four corollaries. **The verdict names the best and the tile's footer the worst**, never the same figure twice — and when the running period IS the record, the headline says so and the sentence drops its own placing clause. **A podium place gets a word, a place past the third gets its number** («il secondo anno migliore», then «al 4° posto tra gli anni»): an ordinal spelled out past the podium reads as praise the position does not carry. **A ranked row's bar encodes rank** — the leading row fills the track — **and takes the chart slot of the quantity ranked**, `--chart-2` for money coming in and money kept, `--chart-1` for net worth and spending; three rankings painted with one slot would say they measure the same thing, and a COST is carried positive and uncoloured because the sign tokens mean gain and loss and nothing else. **A chart beside a ranking answers a different question or it does not belong**: the twelve record months are drawn in chronological order, so the podium ranks and the plot dates; a plot that re-drew the podium in another material would be the One-Tile-One-Question Rule broken inside a single tile.

**The In-Tile Switch Rule** (FIRE › Calcolatore, 2026-08-25). A persisted boolean that changes what a page's BASE counts — the pension lock, which takes the locked capital out of the net worth the FIRE number runs on — lives beside the figure it changes, inside the tile that reads that base, and SAVES on change: a switch is a decision, not a draft, and a preview that had to be committed two disclosures down would leave the reader hunting for a Salva button while every tile already showed the other state. Typed values keep a form with an explicit save (the SWR, the INPS age): a number needs a moment of commitment a switch does not. Three corollaries. **A disabled control says why in visible copy** («non modificabile in demo»), never in a `title`. **The base is ONE figure**: the number, the verdict and the projection read the same expenses — the cashflow year the Base di calcolo tile names in its aside, annualized when it must be and said so — so a fresh account never sees a «non calcolabile» number beside a projection that is being drawn (The Same-Basis Rule, applied to an input). **A nominal figure never stands alone**: the passive income at the FIRE year is given beside today's expenses with the inflation that separates them («2300 € al mese di oggi, 2667 € del 2032 con l'inflazione al 2,5%»), because a future-euro figure printed by itself reads as «more than I spend».

**The Stepped-Line Rule** (FIRE › Coast FIRE, 2026-08-25). A reference line drawn against a series is on the SERIES' composition at every point. When the plotted portfolio gains a compartment — the pension fund re-entering at its unlock — the line it is read against gains the same compartment at the same point: the capital required at the target age is net of the fund until the unlock (what the free assets alone must reach) and gross from there, so the series crosses the line exactly when the verdict says the number is reached. A flat net line beside a stepped series showed the portfolio over the target while 24% of the Coast number was still missing; the fix is in the service (`fireNumberTarget` per year), never in the chart. Two corollaries. **The two capital figures of a verdict are on ONE basis**, and the sentence names what neither includes («I 31.400 € nel fondo pensione sono esclusi da queste cifre perché restano bloccati fino al 2045; il calcolo li conta da quell'anno in poi»). **A page whose one control lives on a sibling tab names its state where its assumptions are declared** — the Ipotesi trigger reads «fondo pensione bloccato fino al 2045», and the Dettaglio says where the switch is — instead of growing a second switch that would save the same field from two places.

**The Input Tile Rule** (FIRE › What If, 2026-08-25). When a page's question is about something the reader TYPES — a life event, a hypothesis — the form is a tile of the grid, not a disclosure under it: the verdict is about what is typed there, so the input sits beside the answer, and on a phone it is the first tile after the verdict (the desktop keeps the dominant chart tile on the left, as every other page). Three corollaries. **The pure layer receives the input in its own terms** — an amount, a number of months, a share of the household income — and never the UI's taxonomy: which salary stops is the picker's business, «31.800 € l'anno di entrate (il 64% del reddito)» is the sentence's. **The only signed figures are the deltas**: a year later is a loss, a lower FIRE number a gain, a bigger Coast gap a loss, and the bounds («da 412.500 € a 380.700 €»), the years and the projections stay uncoloured; an unchanged figure says «invariato», never «+0 €». **An empty input is said, not dressed**: with no amount typed the verdict reads «Nessun evento da simulare.» and says what the plan is today, instead of a zero delta with a neutral tone.

**The Stale-Run Rule** (FIRE › Monte Carlo, 2026-08-26). When a page's figures come from a computation the reader launches — thirty thousand simulated paths, not a formula the tiles could re-evaluate on every keystroke — the page runs it ONCE by itself when the auto-filled inputs settle, so the verdict is read before anything is typed, and afterwards only on an explicit «Esegui»: a run remembers the inputs it was made with, and while the typed inputs differ the tile that holds them says so in the warning tone («I risultati sopra usano i parametri dell'ultima esecuzione: premi Esegui simulazione per aggiornarli») and every other tile keeps the last run's figures. Neither alternative is honest: a silent re-run changes the verdict under the reader's eyes, and a page that waits for a click opens with no answer. Three corollaries. **The median of a run is the median of ALL its paths**, the failed ones counted at zero — a median of the survivors alone («valore mediano delle simulazioni riuscite») overstates a plan that fails often, and stays in the payload without a surface. **A percentile at zero is a state, not an amount**: it prints «esaurito» beside its label and the sentence says «i soldi finiscono», never «0 €». **A histogram with a heavy tail caps its equal-width bins at the 95th percentile** and lets the last bin take the rest, saying so under the plot — ten bins stretched to one outlier are nine empty bins and one full.

### Email Shell and Email Tile (out of the DOM)

The two periodic emails are one card of 600px on `--muted`, `--card` inside a 1px `--border` at
16px radius, and every block in it is a `<tr>` separated from its neighbours by a 1px rule rather
than by a gap. **Every layout is a table**: Outlook on Windows renders through Word, which ignores
flexbox, grid and most of `display`; radius and shadow are stated anyway and simply do not appear
there, which is acceptable because they carry no information. One card of ruled tiles rather than a
column of separate cards is the choice that survives it — there, a stack of cards degrades into a
stack of hard rectangles.

```
[preheader — hidden; it is the VERDICT headline, so the inbox preview answers the question]
[eyebrow «Net Worth Tracker · Riepilogo mensile»]        [scope «Agosto 2026»]
[verdict — 24px/600, the stop in the tone colour]
[sentence — 13px/1.45, figures in the mono stack at 600 with their sign colour]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[tile: eyebrow · scope · reading · figures · footnote over a 1px rule]
```
Built by `lib/server/emailHtml.ts` (`emailShell`, `emailVerdict`, `emailTile`, `emailHero`,
`emailKeyFigures`, `emailRankedRows`, `emailBudgetTrack`, `emailComparisonTable`, `emailAlertRows`);
the words come from `lib/utils/emailNarrative.ts` and the colours from `printTokens`. The AI comment
is a tile on `--muted` in SECOND position, never the opening: its generation is non-blocking, so an
email that opened on it opened on a number whenever the model was unavailable.

**Superseded, 2026-09-01** — the section-per-block email: a 14px bold title over a bordered table
with a `#f8fafc` head row, `▲`/`▼` glyphs for the sign, percentages through `toFixed` (dots), the
Hall of Fame as an emoji pill, and the «Confronti» table printing the previous period beside the
previous year even on a yearly email, where the two are the same window.

### PDF Page and PDF Section

The report is the same cadence at 72 points per inch: `PDFPage` owns the chrome (eyebrow strip ·
1pt rule · content · fixed footer with `n / total`), `PDFSection` the block (eyebrow · scope ·
reading · figures). The ramp is DESIGN.md's own at ≈ ÷ 4/3, each step rounded to the half-point
rather than taken as the quotient — `PDF_RAMP` in `components/pdf/primitives/PDFTile.tsx`: eyebrow 7
· scope 7.5 · reading 9.5 · verdict 22 · hero 26 · metricLabel 6.5 · metricValue 15 · metricNote 7.5
· tableHead 6.5 · tableCell 8.5 · caption 7.5 · footer 7 (so 13px → 9.5pt, not 9.75; 30 → 22, not
22.5; 36 → 26) — so the printed page carries the screen's hierarchy at the same physical size; A4 is
595×842pt on a 44pt margin, leaving a 507pt column.

Two constraints the medium imposes, both declared rather than worked around:

- **No monospace.** `@react-pdf/renderer` ships only the standard PDF families unless font files are
  registered, and Geist reaches this app through `next/font/google`. Figures are set in Helvetica
  and their alignment comes from fixed-width, right-aligned COLUMNS — a deliberate exception to
  **The Mono Mandate**, recorded in `PDF_FONTS`. Courier was the alternative and is worse.
- **No typographic minus.** WinAnsi has no U+2212, and react-pdf drops what it cannot encode
  silently: the Allocazione gaps printed «620» where they meant «−620 €». `pdfSafeText` converts it
  at the boundary, once, for every string that reaches a PDF text node.

Sub-tiles are a `--muted` fill with no border, because on white paper a 1px rule at 0.92 lightness
is invisible and a 4%-ink fill survives a photocopy. Bars are 2.5pt.

**Superseded, 2026-09-01** — the blue report: a `#3B82F6` accent on every page title, a 2pt blue
divider, a pill badge and a 36pt blue "Portfolio Report" filling a cover page that said nothing the
file name did not, `#F3F4F6` zebra rows under a blue table head, and English section titles
("Portfolio Assets", "FIRE Calculator") beside Italian ones.

### Buttons

Each variant has a physical quality: an opacity shift on hover that reads as gentle press, a soft focus ring that glows without screaming. Efficient and tactile.

- **Shape:** Medium curvature (8px radius). Not sharp enough to feel harsh; not rounded enough to feel playful. Matches input fields for optical consistency across form contexts.
- **Primary (dark mode):** `bg-primary` — `--primary` is `oklch(0.922 0 0)` in dark, the Border Stone grey and not the Off-Blanc this file claimed until 2026-09-06 — with `--primary-foreground` text (`oklch(0.205 0 0)`, Charcoal Surface). Height 36px, horizontal padding 16px. Hover: 10% opacity reduction via `/90` modifier — the same token, never a second one.
- **Primary (light mode):** Charcoal Surface fill (`--primary` = `oklch(0.205 0 0)`, not Deep Void), Off-Blanc text. Same geometry, inverted colors.
- **Focus:** `ring-[3px] ring-ring/50` — a soft glow. The `/50` opacity prevents the ring from overwhelming surrounding content.
- **Outline:** Border + `bg-background` (`shadow-xs`), and in dark `bg-input/30` over it — not transparent: on a dark surface a hairline alone does not read as a field. Hover fills with `--accent` surface step. Secondary actions alongside a primary.
- **Ghost:** No border, no background at rest. Hover reveals `--accent` fill at 50% opacity in dark mode. Dense data tables and toolbars where button chrome adds noise.
- **Destructive:** Destructive Flame fill. Irreversible actions only. Never a general negative indicator.
- **Disabled:** `opacity-50`, pointer events off. Shape persists at half presence.

### Cards

Cards organize data panels, KPI groups, and chart containers. Structural, not decorative.

- **Corner Style:** `rounded-2xl` (16px, fixed on every theme). This is the standard for all primary cards, hero cards, and bento cells. Use `rounded-xl` (14px on the default theme; it follows the theme's `--radius`) only for sub-elements inside a card (e.g. muted sub-tiles). Buttons and inputs remain at 8px (md, on the default theme) — the larger radius signals a container, not an interactive target.
- **Background:** `--card` (dark: Charcoal Surface `oklch(0.205 0 0)`; light: Near-White `oklch(1 0 0)`).
- **Shadow Strategy:** Lift shadow (`0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`). Always present; always quiet.
- **Border:** 1px, `--border` (Border Ghost dark; Border Stone light). The border carries most of the compositional separation work.
- **Internal Padding:** `p-5` (20px) for tiles (the unit of every page) and chart containers. The older `p-6` (24px) is acceptable in exactly three places: a modal's header and body (`px-6`), the settings forms, and the ONE tile of Accesso and Registrazione (`p-5 desktop:p-6`, `doc/guide/accesso-registrazione.md`) — a lone tile in a 420px column with 20px of padding reads as cramped where a tile among twelve reads as dense. **Superseded (2026-09-06)** — `p-[22px]`, «for the legacy hero cards still on the un-propagated pages»: no such page and no such card remain (0 uses); the reasoning that 22px felt tighter and more «instrument-like» than 24px at data density carried over into the tile's 20px.

#### Bento Cell (Naked Card Variant)

For bento grid cells that sit alongside a Card component, use the naked pattern — raw `div` instead of the `Card` component — to avoid shadcn's internal flex-col that can break inner layouts:

```tsx
<div className="bg-card border border-border rounded-2xl p-5 flex flex-col justify-between">
```

This is preferred over `<Card><CardContent>` when the cell needs explicit flex direction control or when `flex-1` / `h-full` behavior is critical for grid row height matching.

### Inputs / Fields

- **Style:** Transparent background at rest, 1px stroke (`--input`/`--border`), 8px radius. Height 36px. Whisper shadow (`0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`) for faint depth. Dark mode adds `bg-input/30` fill to signal editability on a dark surface. Type is `text-base md:text-sm` — 16px below `md:`, because iOS zooms the page into any field set smaller; the one size in the app the ramp does not choose.
- **Focus:** `border-ring` + `ring-[3px] ring-ring/50`. The ring opacity softens what would otherwise be an overpowering indicator.
- **Error:** `border-destructive` + `ring-destructive/20`. Error state is communicated through border color, not background change.
- **Placeholder:** `--muted-foreground`. Subdued; clearly not content.
- **Disabled:** `opacity-50 pointer-events-none`. Geometry preserved, content grayed.

### Badges

- **Style:** `rounded-md` (8px), border treatment, `px-2.5 py-0.5`, `text-xs font-semibold`. Height follows content.
- **Default:** Primary fill. Asset type labels, active status indicators.
- **Secondary:** Secondary surface fill. Secondary metadata, lower-emphasis tags.
- **Outline:** Border only, no background. Filter chips and neutral tags where fill adds excess weight.
- **Destructive:** Destructive Flame fill. Delete confirmations, critical status.

### Navigation

The frame recedes so the verdict is the first thing read: nothing in the chrome is louder than a tile's eyebrow, and nothing in the default theme's chrome has a hue.

- **Desktop sidebar** (`components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` over the shadcn primitive): `--sidebar` background, a 13px `font-semibold` wordmark (no filled logo block — a square of `--primary` was the brightest element on the screen), three route groups whose labels are the tiles' eyebrow (`TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS` + `text-sidebar-foreground/60`), one hairline before the assistant, which is a plain route (`assistantNavItem`, no banner), and the account at the bottom: a 28px initials square on `--sidebar-accent`, name 13px, email 11px, in a 44px row. **Active state = `--sidebar-accent` background + `font-semibold`, and nothing else** (the `--sidebar-primary` Indigo statement below is superseded).
- **Icon rail** (collapsed): `3.5rem` wide so every target — routes, toggle, account — is `44×44px` with 6px of padding; the route name is a tooltip on hover.
- **Mobile:** Floating pill at bottom of viewport. `border-radius: 9999px`, `--sidebar` background, `1px solid --sidebar-border`, Float shadow (`0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.28)`). Positioned `bottom: calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px) + 12px)`. Three primary routes + "Altro" drawer trigger, labels 11px. Landscape orientation hides the pill entirely (horizontal screen real estate is used differently) and shows a top bar with the Sheet trigger and the 13px wordmark.
- **"Altro" drawer** (`SecondaryMenuDrawer`): the two secondary groups under the same eyebrow labels as the sidebar ("Analisi", "Pianificazione"), 14px rows of 44px, the assistant as a row after a hairline, the account block with a 44px options button.
- **Active indicator:** Framer Motion animated highlight under active item. State changes trigger instant color switch; a route change runs as a page scene (below).

**The Page Scene (2026-09-12).** A navigation between two dashboard pages is ONE scene, not a page that vanishes and another that fades in: a click on a route link in the sidebar, the bottom pill or the «Altro» drawer (`SceneLink`) wraps `router.push` in a native view transition (`lib/utils/viewTransition.ts`, `useSceneNavigation`), and only the named regions move — the content region (`page-main`, the layout's `<main>`) cross-fades with a 6px settle in 320 ms ease-out-quart while the shell around it stays still, and the header line (`page-header`) and the verdict (`page-verdict`, a name the loading skeleton's verdict block shares) morph from their old box to their new one, so the sentence that answers the page's question is seen changing in place. The scene lands on the next page's skeleton — the tiles arrive as the data does, as before — and `template.tsx`'s fade stands down for that mount. The theme toggle's circle reveal is the other scene; the two are scoped by `data-vt` on `<html>` and never share a rule. Firefox has no view transitions and keeps the template's fade; reduced motion skips the scene. One scene per navigation, and no other shared element than these three: a tile morphing into a tile of another page would claim a relationship the pages do not have.

**Superseded (2026-08-22).** "Active state: `--sidebar-primary` color. In the default dark theme this is Indigo Signal — the only context where a non-achromatic color appears in the default theme on the interface chrome" — the sidebar has used `--sidebar-accent` for the active route since the pill highlight, and the violet assistant banner (the one hue left in the chrome) was retired with the shell redesign. `--sidebar-primary` stays a token of the theme files; no component paints it.

### The Net Worth Counter (Signature Component)

The animated currency counter in Overview KPI cards is the system's most distinctive interactive element. Count-up animation is isolated to the leaf `<span>` containing the value, preventing surrounding layout reflow. `Intl.NumberFormat` results are cached via `cachedFormatCurrencyEUR` to prevent allocation on every render frame. Mounting is deferred through `requestIdleCallback`: the hero section settles first, charts mount after. Numbers land — they count from a prior value, never from zero.

### Variation Chips (Canonical Pattern)

**Superseded (2026-08-22).** Inside a tile the chips are `text-[12px]` with `px-[11px] py-[6px]`, each with an 11px caption under it ("questo mese", "da inizio anno"), grouped in one row from `tablet:` up — see **The Grouped Chip Rule**. The 15px grid-of-equal-columns form below was the Panoramica's and then Patrimonio's hero chip; since Patrimonio's redesign no page renders it. It stays documented for the Equal-Column Chip Rule, which still governs full-width chip rows outside a tile.

Periodic changes (monthly, YTD) are displayed as compact inline chips directly below the hero number — not as separate cards. This keeps the primary number dominant while giving immediate trend context.

**Structure:** `inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-[9px] px-[13px] py-[6px] text-[15px] font-semibold font-mono tracking-[-0.01em]`

**Colors:** (theme-aware tokens — see **The Sign-Color Token Rule**)
- Positive: `bg-positive/10 text-positive`
- Negative: `bg-destructive/10 text-destructive`

Never use raw `bg-green-500/10 text-green-500` / `bg-red-500/10 text-red-500` here: those stay literal red/green regardless of theme and clash with `--destructive` on non-default themes (e.g. Cyberpunk = orange). Resolve the text color via `getMetricValueColor()` (`lib/utils/metricColors.ts`) where practical.

**Content:** `{icon} {+/-}{formattedValue} ({+/-}{pct}%) {period label}` — e.g. `↗ +€1.240,00 (+2.34%) questo mese`

**Rules:** Only render when snapshot data exists (at least one prior period). Never show a placeholder chip — absence communicates "no prior data" cleanly. Icon is `TrendingUp` or `TrendingDown` at `h-[13px] w-[13px]`. A row of several chips is laid out as a grid, not `flex-wrap` — see **The Equal-Column Chip Rule** below. Use `font-mono` for the value — the chip contains a financial number and must satisfy the Mono Mandate.

**Note (delta semantics):** For expense metrics, the sign convention is inverted: a positive delta on Spese is bad (spending went up), a negative delta is good. The color logic must be parameterized, not hard-coded: `positiveGood: boolean` governs the `text-positive` / `text-destructive` assignment.

**The Equal-Column Chip Rule.** A row of same-purpose chips whose labels are different lengths is laid out as a grid — `grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 tablet:grid-cols-2` — never `flex-wrap`. Chips that say the same *kind* of thing should be the same size; under `flex-wrap` each one shrinks to its own content, so "questo mese" and "da inizio anno" end up different widths and a wrapped third chip lands at a width unrelated to the two above it. Grid columns size together across every row, so a lone third chip still matches the first column — the alignment is a consequence of the layout, with no JS measurement and no fixed width. One column on mobile (each chip takes the full card width), two from `tablet:` up. `flex-wrap` remains correct where chips are genuinely heterogeneous and are meant to flow, such as filter tags. Superseded inside tiles by The Grouped Chip Rule (2026-08-22).

### Dominant Value Block (Trade Republic Pattern)

The canonical layout for any section where one number is the primary takeaway — asset value, allocation total, account balance.

**Structure:**
```
[eyebrow label — text-[10px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.1em] text-muted-foreground]
[primary value — text-[44px] desktop:text-[54px] font-bold font-mono tracking-[-0.03em]]
[variation chips — inline-flex, laid out as grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 tablet:grid-cols-2]
[tertiary metadata — text-[11px] text-muted-foreground]
```

**Rules:**
- Primary value is always `font-bold font-mono`. Page heroes use `text-[44px] desktop:text-[54px]`. Section heroes use `text-[36px]`. Sub-hero paired values use `text-[22px]`. Never `text-2xl` (24px) for a page or section hero — the jump from 22→36→44→54 is intentional.
- The eyebrow label above is `text-[10px]` uppercase and muted — it names the number without competing with it.
- Variation (gain/loss, percentage) appears inline directly below the value as chips, never as a separate card or column.
- Tertiary metadata (count, footnote) uses `text-[11px] text-muted-foreground` — present for reference, invisible at a glance.
- Never place two equally-weighted numbers side by side. One must dominate; the other is context.

### Flat List Row (Trade Republic Chrome Reduction)

The canonical pattern for lists of financial items — assets, allocation rows, transaction history — where card-within-card nesting would add visual weight without adding information.

**Structure:** `divide-y divide-border` container, each row is a `flex items-center justify-between py-3 px-0` div (no background, no border-radius, no shadow).

**Rules:**
- No card box per row. The `divide-y` line is the only separator.
- Container may live inside a Card for page-level organization, but rows inside are always flat.
- Hover state: `hover:bg-muted/30` — barely perceptible, confirms interactivity without adding chrome.
- Row content follows Dominant Value Block hierarchy: primary value right-aligned in `font-mono`, label left-aligned.
- Use this pattern wherever a `<ul>` of items would otherwise become a grid of `<Card>` boxes.

### ActionChip

A compact, text-only chip for contextual financial actions (buy / sell / hold signals, allocation status). Replaces color-coded icons where the action label carries more information than the icon.

**Variants:** COMPRA / VENDI / OK, each in the action hue `useActionColors()` resolves from the theme's chart slots (3 / 5 / 2, lightness-clamped so the text stays legible on both modes), with the background and the border as `color-mix` tints of the same hue (14% / 34%). Never the sign tokens: a drift is neither a gain nor a loss (The Scope-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule). The `bg-green-500/10 … border-green-500/20` literals the chip was born with are gone.

**Structure:** `inline-flex items-center gap-0.5 rounded-full border px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[10px] font-semibold` with a 10px directional icon (TrendingUp / TrendingDown / Minus) before the label. Since 2026-08-25 it lives in the Piano and Per classe tiles of Allocazione, and the Bilanciamento ring takes the same three hues (≥ 92 OK · ≥ 80 COMPRA · below VENDI).

**Rules:**
- The label is the signal; the ONE 10px directional icon before it (`h-2.5 w-2.5`, `aria-hidden`) is the sign a reader takes in before the word, never a second signal and never larger. (The «text only» rule this section carried until 2026-09-06 contradicted its own structure line.)
- Never use ActionChip for navigation or primary actions. It is a status indicator, not a button.
- On touch devices, ensure minimum 32px tap height via parent padding.

### Segmented Pill Control

A tab switcher for mutually exclusive views within a section. Replaces `<Select>` dropdowns where options are few and always visible. The active pill animates via Framer Motion `layoutId` spring.

**Structure:** `role="tablist"` container with `bg-muted rounded-lg p-1 w-fit mx-auto`, each option is a `role="tab"` `motion.button` with `layout="size"`. Active pill is a `motion.div` with `layoutId` and `bg-background shadow-sm` that slides between options.

**Spring:** `stiffness: 400, damping: 35` — snappy without overshooting. Same constant on both `motion.button` `transition` and `motion.div` `transition`, and on every control that slides between two states. Four springs are NOT `400 / 35`, each for a reason (counted in the code on 2026-09-18 — until then this paragraph said «all but one»): the bottom pill's «add expense» button enters at `400 / 28` (`components/layout/BottomNavigation.tsx:41`), a touch of overshoot on the one element that pops in from nothing; `springLayoutTransition` is `280 / 30`, mass 0.9 (`lib/utils/motionVariants.ts`), softer because it moves whole REGIONS when a conditional section appears — the `layout="position"` wrappers of Panoramica and Patrimonio; `metricSettleTransition` is `320 / 34`, mass 0.8 (same file), a figure that must land without a bounce — today only the Dividendi calendar; and the savings-rate badge enters at `300 / 20` (`components/ui/SavingsRateBadge.tsx:112`), inline and collapsed to duration 0 under reduced motion. A fifth value needs the same kind of sentence here.

#### Variant A — Icon tabs (section navigation)

Used in `PageTabBar` for pages with multiple named sections (Cashflow, Settings, FIRE). Each tab has a meaningful icon.

- **Active tab:** icon + full label. `motion.button layout="size"` expands smoothly.
- **Inactive tabs:** icon only — label hidden. Tabs shrink to icon width.
- **Fallback:** if a tab has no icon, always show the label regardless of active state.
- **Centering:** `w-fit mx-auto` on the container — the pill sizes to content and centers in the page.
- **Implementation:** `components/layout/PageTabBar.tsx`

#### Variant B — Text tabs (period / filter selection)

Used for compact period selectors where labels ARE the identifier and no icons exist. (Rendimenti's YTD / 1A / 3A / 5A / MAX strip was this variant until 2026-08-25; its axis is now a `SegmentedPill` beside the verdict, like Dividendi's, with «Periodo personalizzato» as a header action and a chip — never a slot — while active. Allocazione's band strip and its Ribilancia | Versa | Preleva switch were this variant too until 2026-08-25; both became `AsideToggle`s in their tiles' asides, the band with its custom `pp` field beside it.)

- All options always show their label (already ≤3–4 chars — no overflow risk).
- Uses underline `motion.div` indicator instead of background pill — appropriate for horizontal period strips.
- Do not force icons onto period selectors. "1 year" has no meaningful icon.

**Shared rules:**
- Full ARIA: `role="tablist"` on container, `role="tab"` + `aria-selected` per button.
- Only use for view-switching within a page section. Global navigation uses the bottom pill or sidebar.
- Desktop (`≥ 1440px`): `PageTabBar` renders the animated underline tab bar instead, so Variant A's pill is mobile-only (`desktop:hidden`). `SegmentedPill` itself is not (corrected 2026-09-06): as a page's AXIS it sits beside the verdict on every width — Rendimenti's `PerformancePeriodPicker`, Analisi's `AnalisiPeriodControls`, the Assistente's `AssistantPeriodSelector`, Previdenza's fiscal year (`PensionOverview`), the ranking switcher in Hall of Fame's Dettaglio, and the recurrence-frequency switch inside `ExpenseDialog`.

### Bento Asymmetric Hero Layout

**Superseded (2026-08-22).** The Panoramica no longer uses the `[2fr_1fr]` hero + companion; it uses the **Tile Grid** above, where the dominant tile spans 5 of 12 columns and two rows. The pattern below stays documented because the Assistente keeps it on purpose — the conversation is the content, and the companion is a sticky column of tiles (The Conversation-Is-Content Rule, 2026-08-27); Rendimenti, Allocazione, FIRE › Calcolatore and Coast FIRE left it on 2026-08-25, Previdenza and the Obiettivi hero on 2026-08-26. Redesign any other page onto the Tile Grid, do not add new `[2fr_1fr]` pages.

The canonical top-of-page layout when a hero card needs a companion context card (e.g. Overview: Net Worth + Liquidity, Performance: TWR + period selector).

**Structure:** `grid gap-4 desktop:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]`

- The `[2fr_1fr]` ratio gives the hero approximately 66% width and the companion 33%. This is not a 50/50 split — the asymmetry is intentional and communicates hierarchy through space allocation.
- On mobile, the grid stacks: hero first, companion second.
- The companion card uses `h-full` to match the hero's variable height (sparkline, chips, etc.).
- Below the hero row, a secondary bento row uses equal `grid-cols-3` (or `grid-cols-2`) for metric cards of equal weight.

**Section separator:** Use `border-t border-border/40 pt-4` between major page sections. The 40% border opacity is lighter than the standard `border-border` — it suggests chapter separation without visual interruption.

### Hero Sparkline (Edge-to-Edge Area Chart)

A minimal area chart rendered inside the hero card, breaking out of card padding to fill the full card width. No axes, no grid, no legend — the variation chips above carry numeric context; the sparkline adds only visual shape. Since 2026-08-22 a mouse reads a point (`interactive`, **The Hover Reading Rule** below); the touch surfaces keep the bare shape.

**Implementation** (the live form, `components/dashboard/overview/PatrimonioTile.tsx:170`):
```tsx
{/* Container with negative margin matching the TILE's padding (p-5), stretching to the tile's free height */}
<div className="relative -mx-5 mt-3 min-h-[180px] flex-1 [&_svg]:absolute [&_svg]:inset-0 [&_svg]:h-full [&_svg]:w-full">
  <NetWorthSparkline data={sparkline12m} filled={true} color="var(--chart-1)" interactive />
</div>
{/* Start/end labels rendered by parent, outside the -mx container */}
<div className="flex justify-between mt-1 px-px text-[10px] text-muted-foreground font-mono">
  <span>{cachedFormatCurrencyEUR(sparkline12m[0].totalNetWorth, true)}</span>
  <span>{cachedFormatCurrencyEUR(sparkline12m[sparkline12m.length - 1].totalNetWorth, true)}</span>
</div>
```

**Rules:**
- The `-mx-[N]` value must match the container's padding exactly: `-mx-5` for the tile's `p-5`. (**Superseded, 2026-09-06** — `-mx-[22px]` for `p-[22px]`, the hero card's pair: 0 uses.) The SVG uses `preserveAspectRatio="none"` and `width="100%"` to fill the container.
- When `filled=true`, the `NetWorthSparkline` component expects the parent to render the start/end labels externally — it does not render them internally to avoid misalignment with the bleed.
- Use `color="var(--chart-1)"` so the sparkline respects theme. Never hard-code a hex.
- Gradient fill: opacity `0.22` at top, `0` at bottom. This is intentionally subtle — the area shape conveys trend, not emphasis.

### Animated SVG Donut (Inline Data Viz)

A two-color SVG donut rendered directly inside a card (no Recharts), with a `motion.circle` for the animated segment. Used when a pie metaphor must integrate tightly with text values in a flex layout.

**Anatomy:**
- Full background ring: static `<circle>` in color A (e.g. illiquid / base category).
- Animated segment: `<motion.circle>` in color B (e.g. liquid / primary category), animating `strokeDasharray` from `0 circ` to `liquidDash circ-liquidDash`.
- Center label: `absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-center` with the percentage in `font-mono font-bold` at `fontSize={17}` (matching the center of the 116px ring).
- SVG rotated `-90deg` so the segment starts at the top (12 o'clock position).

**Geometry:**
- `size = 116`, `strokeW = 12`, `r = (size - strokeW) / 2`
- `circ = 2 * Math.PI * r` — do not hard-code; always derive from `r`.

**Animation:** `duration: 0.8, ease: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1], delay: 0.15` — expo-out feel with a brief delay after the hero number starts.

**Colors:** Always from `useChartColors()`. The first time `chartColors` is read, it may be `[]` (post-hydration); default to CSS vars (`var(--chart-1)`, `var(--chart-2)`) as fallbacks.

**Rules:**
- Use this pattern when the donut is integral to the card layout and must flex-align with text. Use Recharts `PieChart` only for standalone chart sections.
- `strokeLinecap="butt"` — not `"round"`, which would add visual overlap at 0% and 100% endpoints.
- Center text font size should scale with `size`: `fontSize = Math.round(size * 0.147)` (approx).

### Savings / Metric Ring Chart

**Superseded, and its one implementation deleted on 2026-08-31 with the landing propagation** (`components/dashboard/SavingsRingChart.tsx`): the public landing was the last surface drawing one, and it now shows the savings rate the way every other surface does — the Cashflow tile's three figures with the rate as its caption. A ring spends 88px on one percentage that a 22px mono figure states exactly, and the three literal hexes below were the last sign colours on the page that did not follow the theme. With it went the app's LAST `useAnimation` call site — the single-mount pattern below is now documentation without an implementation, kept because the reasoning (a ring is a snapshot, not a live gauge) is what the next one will need. What is retired is the ring as the way to show a single RATE. **One ring remains, and it is not that** (stated 2026-09-06): `components/allocation/BalanceRing.tsx`, the 84px `motion.circle` in Allocazione's Bilanciamento tile, draws the balance SCORE — a figure on a fixed 0-100 domain, where «how far from 100» is the part-of-whole read the pie rule below allows for a single slice, and where the arc's colour is an action hue (OK / COMPRA / VENDI), never a sign token. It animates through `initial`/`animate` on the element with `useReducedMotion`, not through `useAnimation`; it is the tree's only `motion.circle`, and the next ring must be a score with a bounded domain, or it must be a figure.

An SVG ring chart for a single percentage metric (e.g. savings rate). Structurally similar to the animated donut but single-color on a muted track ring.

**Color thresholds (savings rate):**
- `≥ 20%`: green — `oklch(0.696 0.17 142.5)`
- `10–19%`: amber — `var(--chart-3)`
- `< 10%` or negative: red/coral — `oklch(0.645 0.246 16.439)`

**Single-mount animation pattern:** The ring animates once when the component mounts — never on parent re-renders. Achieved via `useAnimation` + `useEffect` with an empty dependency array (`[]`):

```tsx
const controls = useAnimation();
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    controls.start({
      strokeDasharray: `${dash} ${circ - dash}`,
      transition: { duration: 0.9, ease: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] },
    });
  }, 400);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []); // intentionally empty — animate once on mount only
```

**Rules:**
- The `[]` dependency on the animation effect is intentional — the ring is a "snapshot display" of the current rate, not a live-updating gauge. If the ring must react to data changes, use explicit `key` prop rotation on the parent to force re-mount.
- For a deficit (rate < 0): render the track ring only, show the negative label in red, suppress the filled segment entirely.

### Collapsible with Framer Motion Height

**Superseded (2026-09-06)** — documentation without an implementation: no file in the tree pairs a `CollapsibleTrigger` with an `AnimatePresence`. The disclosures of the redesigned pages («Dettaglio», «Parametri», «Ipotesi», «Impostazioni», «Archiviati») open on Radix `Collapsible` alone (`components/ui/collapsible.tsx`), and the expandable rows of Strumenti use the CSS `grid-rows-[0fr] → [1fr]` technique with `inert` (see **Table inside a Tile**). The snippet stays for the rules under it, which still hold if a height animation is ever needed.

The pattern for smooth expand/collapse of a section that has variable or unknown height. Combines Radix `Collapsible` (for ARIA state and keyboard accessibility) with Framer Motion (for the height animation that Radix alone cannot provide smoothly).

**Structure:**
```tsx
<Collapsible open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
  <CollapsibleTrigger asChild>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between cursor-pointer select-none px-5 py-4">
      <p className="text-[10px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.1em] text-muted-foreground">
        Section Title
      </p>
      <ChevronDown className={cn('h-3.5 w-3.5 transition-transform duration-200', open && 'rotate-180')} />
    </div>
  </CollapsibleTrigger>
  <AnimatePresence initial={false}>
    {open && (
      <motion.div
        key="content-key"
        initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ height: 'auto', opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.28, ease: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1] }}
        style={{ overflow: 'hidden' }}
      >
        {/* content */}
      </motion.div>
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
</Collapsible>
```

**Rules:**
- `AnimatePresence initial={false}` — prevents the exit animation from playing on the first render (the section starts closed; no exit needed before it was ever opened).
- `overflow: 'hidden'` on the `motion.div` (inline style, not className) — prevents content from visually overflowing during the height-0 phase.
- `height: 'auto'` as the animate target works correctly with Framer Motion; no `maxHeight` hack needed.
- The `ChevronDown rotate-180` transform should use `transition-transform duration-200` (CSS) not a Framer Motion variant — it's a decorative indicator, not a structural animation.
- Collapsibles default to **closed** for secondary/optional content. Auto-open only when there is unsaved state or a first-use condition that justifies it.

### Muted Sub-tile

A tinted grid item for compact KPI grids. Two variants exist for different contexts.

#### Variant A — KPI Chip (prominent, borderless)

Used in persistent full-width sections where the metrics are the primary content. Background is semi-transparent so it reads as a zone without visual heaviness. (The cashflow KPI row that introduced it retired with the Tracciamento redesign on 2026-08-22 — inside a tile the KPIs are the bare 22px trio of the Cashflow tile, no chip. The FIRE calculator's scenario strip left it on 2026-08-25 — the three scenarios are rows of the Scenari tile; Goals and Previdenza followed on 2026-08-26, and the tax modal went onto the dialog vocabulary on 2026-08-31 — its summary is one `rounded-xl bg-muted/40 p-4` block of the modal's body, a sub-tile and not a KPI grid.)

```tsx
<div className="bg-muted/40 rounded-xl p-3.5">
  <p className="text-[11px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.06em] text-muted-foreground mb-1.5">
    Label
  </p>
  <p className="text-[22px] font-bold font-mono tabular-nums text-foreground leading-none">
    Value
  </p>
  <p className="text-[12px] font-mono mt-1.5 text-muted-foreground">
    Secondary / delta line
  </p>
</div>
```

Grid: `grid grid-cols-2 desktop:grid-cols-4 gap-3`. Value scale: Sub-hero (`text-[22px]`). Delta annotation uses the **Delta Annotation** typographic level (sign-aware color).

**Superseded (2026-08-26).** The last KPI-chip grid on a propagated surface was the Obiettivi hero («Da accantonare / mese», «Non assegnato», «Prossima scadenza»); on the tile grid the same facts are the Obiettivi footer, the Assegnazioni reading and the free-shares column. It stayed documented «for the page not yet propagated (Previdenza)» — Previdenza was propagated the same day, and the class string `bg-muted/40 rounded-xl p-3.5` has had 0 uses since (confirmed 2026-09-06). Documentation without an implementation, kept only so the shared rules below can name what Variant B is NOT.

#### Variant B — Parameter Tile (dense, bordered)

Used inside collapsible sections where slight extra separation aids readability of many parameters side by side — the scenario parameters of FIRE › Calcolatore's «Parametri» disclosure keep it (2026-08-25): three bordered tiles, one per scenario, inside the Scenari tile of the disclosure. FIRE › Monte Carlo's Parametri tile (2026-08-26) uses it for the three market scenarios too — the one tile of a grid, rather than a disclosure, that keeps it, because the plan IS the tile and its scenarios are its densest block.

```tsx
<div className="bg-muted rounded-xl p-3.5 border border-border">
  <p className="text-[9.5px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.08em] text-muted-foreground mb-1.5">
    Label
  </p>
  <p className="text-[16px] font-bold font-mono tabular-nums">Value</p>
</div>
```

**Shared rules:**
- Background is `bg-muted/40` (Variant A) or `bg-muted` (Variant B) — never `bg-card` (card-within-card violation).
- Radius is `rounded-xl` (14px), one step below the container's `rounded-2xl`.
- Variant A (KPI chip): use for persistent, always-visible metrics. No border — the background tint alone provides definition.
- Variant B (parameter tile): use inside collapsible parameter panels only. The border adds precision in high-density config grids.

### Thin Category Bar

A minimal inline progress bar for category breakdowns inside a KPI card. Shows proportional weight at a glance without mounting a full chart component.

**Structure:**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-3">
  {categories.map(cat => (
    <div key={cat.name} className="space-y-1">
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2 min-w-0">
          {/* Dot indicator — circle, always rounded-full */}
          <div className="w-2 h-2 rounded-full flex-shrink-0" style={{ background: color }} />
          <span className="text-[13px] text-foreground truncate">{cat.name}</span>
        </div>
        <span className="text-[13px] font-mono tabular-nums text-foreground ml-3 flex-shrink-0">
          {formattedValue}
        </span>
      </div>
      {/* Bar track */}
      <div className="h-[3px] bg-muted rounded-full overflow-hidden">
        <div className="h-full rounded-full" style={{ width: `${cat.percentage}%`, background: color }} />
      </div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

**Rules:**
- Bar height is exactly `3px` — an accent shape, not the primary data carrier. Category name and value carry the data; the bar adds scannable shape.
- Color from `useChartColors()` via the parent — never hardcoded hex. Expense categories use `chartColors[0]`; income categories use `chartColors[1]`.
- Row dot indicator uses `rounded-full` (circle). Contrast this with the chart legend swatch below, which uses `rounded-[2px]` (square) — circles mean "inline indicator," squares mean "color key."
- Use `truncate` on the category name with `min-w-0` on the flex parent to prevent overflow on long names.
- Only render the entire block when data is available (`categories.length > 0`) — no placeholder bars with dummy widths.
- Two-column layout inside a card: expenses left, income right via `grid desktop:grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4`. On mobile they stack.

### Card Sticky Footer

**Superseded (2026-09-06)** — the `<Card>` + `p-[22px]` form below has 0 implementations (`<Card>` survives in one gated dev-tools block). The live form of the same idea is the tile's footer: `Tile` is already `flex flex-col` and the grid cell stretches it (`[&>section]:flex-1`), so the secondary fact is `mt-auto border-t border-border pt-3.5` with nothing else required (see **Tile** and **The One-Tile-One-Question Rule**); the rule that only OPTIONAL content is anchored this way still holds.

A technique for pinning secondary metric content to the bottom of a variable-height Card. Used when optional data (TER, costs) should align to the card baseline regardless of how much primary content is above it.

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<Card className="rounded-2xl overflow-hidden h-full">
  <CardContent className="p-[22px] flex flex-col h-full">
    {/* Primary content — fills available space naturally */}
    <p className="eyebrow">...</p>
    <div className="value">...</div>
    {/* Sticky footer — pushed to the bottom via mt-auto */}
    {hasOptionalData && (
      <div className="mt-auto pt-4 border-t border-border">
        {/* secondary metrics */}
      </div>
    )}
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**Rules:**
- Requires `flex flex-col h-full` on `CardContent` and `h-full` on `Card`. Without both, `mt-auto` collapses.
- The containing grid row must also define a height (`h-full` propagates from the row in `desktop:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]`). On mobile where the grid stacks, each card determines its own height naturally.
- Use only for **optional/conditional** secondary content. Footer content that always renders should be placed at a fixed spacing from the primary block, not anchored via `mt-auto`.
- `border-t border-border` provides visual separation; `pt-4` provides breathing room. `mt-auto` creates the push — no explicit `flex-1` spacer element needed.
- On desktop, pair with the companion card's `h-full` so the sticky footer visually aligns with the companion card's bottom edge.

### CompositionList and CompositionBar (Ranked Comparison and Composition)

Two related primitives replace pie/donut charts everywhere the question is a magnitude
comparison or a full breakdown, not a simple part-of-whole read:

- **`CompositionList`** (`components/ui/composition-list.tsx`): a `divide-y` list of rows —
  label + bar + mono value + `%` — for "which items are biggest, by how much" with 6+ items
  (category breakdowns, per-payer rankings). Bar width is `value / maxValue` (the largest item
  fills the track), NOT `percentage` — width encodes rank, the trailing `%` encodes share.
  Using `percentage` as width leaves every bar looking short whenever no single item
  dominates the total, recreating the empty-card problem this primitive exists to solve.
- **`CompositionBar`** (`components/ui/composition-bar.tsx`): a single stacked bar (all
  segments summing to ~100%) plus an optional inline legend — "what does the whole composition
  look like" in one glance, for a handful of segments (asset classes, allocation categories).
  Allocazione's Bilanciamento tile draws the current mix over the target mix as two of these
  (`showLegend={false}`) over ONE legend («Azioni 58,4% → 55%»), so the distance between the two
  mixes reads as a misalignment of segment boundaries; its Previdenza tile pairs a bar with a
  `CompositionList` per scope (the fund, the whole wealth).

**Rule — when a pie/donut is still correct:** only for a genuine part-of-whole question with
≤5 slices AND some information a flat row wouldn't carry (e.g. an active-slice highlight
synced to a list selection, or a hand-rolled SVG donut integral to a hero card layout — see
Animated SVG Donut below). Everywhere else — 6+ items, no extra per-slice interaction — use
`CompositionList` or `CompositionBar` (on a redesigned page the tile form of the same idea is **Ranked Rows with Residual**: Analisi's composition lists moved into tiles as clickable `RankedRows` on 2026-08-25, and `CompositionList` remains on Previdenza and in Allocazione's Previdenza tile, where it prints its share through chartService's formatter since 2026-08-25). This extends the existing Liquidità rule below: a donut
was replaced by flat rows there for the same reason (chrome reduction, more information with
less visual noise); pie charts as drill-down or ranking UI carry that same anti-pattern at a
larger scale (Analisi's 5 pies, Overview's 2 compact pies, Dividendi's per-payer pie all showed
this — see the 2026-07-13 pie-chart redesign). As of that redesign, **the app has zero
Recharts `<Pie>` usages left** — the one remaining candidate, Obiettivi's goal-allocation
donut, turned out to be dead code (`GoalAllocationPieChart.tsx`, 0 importers — the donut had
already been dropped from `GoalBasedInvestingTab` in an earlier session in favor of the goal
list, and the file was removed rather than polished once this was discovered).

### Chart Legend Swatch

**A chart's legend is `components/ui/series-legend.tsx`** (2026-09-20), never Recharts' `<Legend>`: that one prints each label in its series colour — a chart slot as 11px text measured 3,64 · 4,02 · 2,62:1 — and names its icons in English. The words stay in the neutral ink, one entry per SERIES: a bar drawn in the loss token under the baseline is the same series in another state, so its entry carries two swatches («Mercato (rosso se in perdita)») rather than being a fourth entry.

The color swatch used in composition bar / chart legend rows. At 8×8px, shape matters: a fully round circle reads as a "dot indicator" (inline traffic-light semantics); a slightly rounded square reads as a "color key."

**Structure** (the live form, `components/ui/composition-bar.tsx`; the `text-[11.5px]` + `toFixed(1)` snippet this section carried until 2026-09-06 had 0 uses and broke **The Comma Rule**):
```tsx
<li className="flex items-center gap-1.5">
  {/* Square swatch — rounded-[2px], NOT rounded-full; a colour key carries no text, so aria-hidden */}
  <span className="h-2 w-2 shrink-0 rounded-[2px]" style={{ backgroundColor: seg.color }} aria-hidden="true" />
  <span className="text-[11px] text-muted-foreground">{seg.label}</span>
  <span className="font-mono text-[11px] tabular-nums text-foreground">
    {formatPercentage(seg.displayPct ?? seg.pct)}
  </span>
</li>
```

**Rules:**
- `rounded-[2px]` for legend swatches (color keys). `rounded-full` for inline dot indicators (category bars, status bullets).
- Filter legend rows to `percentage >= 5` — slices below 5% don't warrant a label at the available width.
- Value shown is `percentage` (not raw currency) — the chart slice already communicates proportion; the legend reinforces it numerically.
- Container: `flex flex-col gap-[7px]` with `min-w-0` to handle truncation of long asset names.

### Deferred Chart Mount (Performance Pattern)

**Scope note (2026-08-22).** The Panoramica no longer needs this: its composition is a `CompositionBar` (div segments) and its sparkline a hand-written SVG, neither heavy enough to compete with the count-up. The pattern remains correct for pages that mount Recharts after a hero count-up.

**Superseded (2026-09-06)** — documentation without an implementation: `chartRenderReady`, `setChartRenderReady` and `revealedCharts` exist in no file, and `OverviewAnimatedCurrency`'s `onSettled` has no consumer — the producer survived the page that read it. What is NOT superseded is the count-up isolation paragraph below, which the leaf component still enforces; the deferral steps stay as the recipe for the day a Recharts chart lands under a count-up again.

When heavy SVG charts (Recharts, custom SVG) would compete with a count-up animation on the same page, defer their mount until the animation completes.

**Implementation:**
1. The hero count-up component (`OverviewAnimatedCurrency`) accepts an `onSettled` callback that fires exactly once when `animated === value` (after the rAF loop ends).
2. The page sets a `heroSettled` boolean when `onSettled` fires.
3. The chart section watches `heroSettled` and schedules its own `chartRenderReady` state via `requestIdleCallback` (with `setTimeout(0)` fallback):

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (!heroSettled || chartRenderReady) return;
  if (typeof window.requestIdleCallback === 'function') {
    window.requestIdleCallback(() => setChartRenderReady(true), { timeout: 800 });
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => setChartRenderReady(true), 0);
  }
}, [heroSettled, chartRenderReady]);
```

4. Until `chartRenderReady`, the chart section renders a loading placeholder (`<Loader2 animate-spin>`).
5. On mobile or with `prefers-reduced-motion`, skip the delay entirely (`chartRenderReady` starts `true`).

**Count-up isolation:** The count-up `useCountUp` hook lives in a leaf `OverviewAnimatedCurrency` component — **not** in the page component. Each rAF tick only re-renders the tiny leaf span, not the entire page tree. This is non-negotiable: a count-up inside a page component will re-render every card on every frame.

**Revealed-charts tracking:** Use a `Set<string>` (`revealedCharts`) to track which chart IDs have already completed their entrance animation. Pass `animateOnMount={!revealedCharts.has(id)}` to prevent Recharts from replaying entrance animations when tabs switch or data refreshes.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** open every redesigned page with a verdict sentence before any number (The Verdict-First Rule). The question changes per page — "come va il mese?" on the Panoramica, "quanto rende?" on Rendimenti — the shape does not: headline with a tone-coloured full stop, then the facts with mono figures in the prose.
- **Do** give every tile a reading line — the answer in words, 13px, above the figures — and keep each tile to one question (The One-Tile-One-Question Rule). If two tiles would show the same rows, one of them is the wrong tile.
- **Do** declare sample figures ONCE, at the head of the region they fill, in the eyebrow's voice (**The Sample-Data Rule**) — and keep the arithmetic between them true even though the figures are invented, with the relations pinned by tests.
- **Do** close a ranked list with its residual ("Altre categorie · 912 € · 21%") whenever the rows are a share of a stated total. A list that does not add up reads as missing data.
- **Do** put a projection next to its reference and name it as a projection ("Al ritmo attuale ~6.161 €" beside "A luglio 4.109 €"). Extrapolate spending only — a salary lands once, so a linear projection of income is nonsense.
- **Do** give a hand-written chart a hover reading through `components/ui/chart-hover.tsx`, under `(pointer: fine)` only (The Hover Reading Rule) — the figures it shows must already exist for touch and screen readers in the reading line, the `<title>`s and the `aria-label`.
- **Do** let a period switch transform the tiles instead of remounting them (The Period-Transforms Rule): no `key` on a grid that changes with an axis, the figure glides, the series resamples and glides, the heatmap cross-fades, the ranked rows re-rank; the hover and every printed figure read the landed data.
- **Do** run a route change as a page scene (`SceneLink`, The Page Scene) with exactly three named regions — `page-main`, `page-header`, `page-verdict` — and keep every `::view-transition-*` rule scoped by `html[data-vt=…]`.
- **Don't** let a plotted series drive the other tiles of an axis-less page under the pointer (the retired Scrub Rule): a hover reads the chart it is on, and the page's figures stay today's.
- **Do** stretch an edge-to-edge chart with the SVG positioned `absolute inset-0` inside a `relative flex-1 min-h-[…]` box (`preserveAspectRatio="none"`). An in-flow `<svg>` with `height: 100%` in an auto-height parent takes its height from its own viewBox ratio — hundreds of pixels — and explodes the grid row.
- **Do** let `PageHeader` be the compact header on every page: eyebrow · title · description on one line, actions right, no separator, the verdict as the real headline (the `legacy` variant was deleted on 2026-08-26 with the last page that used it). The mobile sticky navbar is unchanged.
- **Do** use one eyebrow for the frame and the content (The One-Eyebrow Rule): `TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS` names a tile's question, the compact header's section and a navigation group alike.
- **Do** load a redesigned page with `TileGridSkeleton` and its own `cells` — one skeleton component for every page, the verdict lines plus the grid, nothing else.
- **Do** name an absence: nothing recorded, a measured zero, or a failed read — three different sentences, three different forms, and never a zero standing in for the other two (**The Absence-Has-Three-Names Rule**).
- **Do** guard every pulse with `motion-safe:` and mark every skeleton placeholder `aria-hidden`; the wait is announced once, by the block.
- **Do** give an explicit width to controls with no intrinsic one (`PeriodSelector` is `flex-1` buttons) when they sit in a flex row, or the labels collapse into one word.
- **Do** derive every visual choice from function — form follows function. Before adding any property (a color, a shadow, a radius, a motion, an extra pixel of size), name the job it does. If the only answer is "it looks nice," remove it. Form is the consequence of function, never its costume.
- **Do** use Geist Mono with `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1` for every monetary value, percentage, and structured date. Column alignment is a trust signal.
- **Do** paint the active route with `--sidebar-accent` and nothing else. The navigation chrome of the default theme has no hue: the assistant is a route, not a violet banner.
- **Do** use the Float shadow exclusively for elements that leave document flow (modals, the mobile nav pill, dropdown menus). Never apply it to in-flow cards.
- **Do** respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Framer Motion's `useReducedMotion()` is integrated across all animated components and must be preserved on new additions.
- **Do** use `desktop:` (1440px) as the primary responsive breakpoint for layout switches. Never use `lg:` (1024px) for wide-screen layouts — iPad Mini in landscape is 1024px and receives the mobile treatment by design.
- **Do** use `oklch()` for all custom color definitions. This project is OKLCH-native; hex values in CSS are approximations of the canonical color.
- **Do** let the five named themes handle personality. Resist adding theme-like color to the default palette.
- **Do** use the view-transition circle reveal (`0.45s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`) for dark/light mode toggling. The origin coordinates are set inline from the click position.
- **Do** use `requestIdleCallback` (with `setTimeout(0)` fallback) to schedule heavy SVG mount after a count-up animation settles. The `heroSettled + chartRenderReady` pattern prevents frame budget competition between animations and chart render. (No page implements it since the Panoramica's charts became hand-written SVG — see **Deferred Chart Mount**, superseded 2026-09-06; the guidance is for the next Recharts chart under a count-up.)
- **Do** isolate count-up animations in leaf components (`OverviewAnimatedCurrency`), not in the page component. Each rAF tick re-renders only the leaf, keeping the rest of the tree stable.
- **Do** use `useAnimation + useEffect([])` (empty deps) for "animate once on mount" ring charts. This prevents the ring from restarting whenever a parent component re-renders due to unrelated state changes. (No surface draws a RATE ring since 2026-08-31; the one ring left, `BalanceRing`, is a bounded 0-100 score animated through `initial`/`animate` under `useReducedMotion` — the guidance here is for the next ring that would need `useAnimation`, not for a live one.)
- **Do** use a negative margin matching the container's padding — `-mx-5` for the tile's `p-5` — to create edge-to-edge charts inside a tile — `preserveAspectRatio="none"` on the SVG fills the broken-out container correctly.
- **Do** use the 12-column Tile Grid for a redesigned page (dominant tile `desktop:col-span-5 desktop:row-span-2`). `desktop:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]` survives only on the Assistente, where the conversation is the content (The Conversation-Is-Content Rule).
- **Do** use `border-t border-border/40 pt-4` for section separators within a page scroll flow. The 40% opacity is lighter than structural borders — it suggests chapter, not division.
- **Do** reserve the full-opacity `bg-muted` with `border border-border` for parameter tiles (Muted Sub-tile, Variant B) — inside a tile the KPIs are bare figures, and a summary block inside a modal is a sub-tile on `bg-muted`. (The `bg-muted/40 rounded-xl p-3.5` KPI chip grid this Do used to prescribe is superseded and has 0 uses — see Muted Sub-tile, Variant A.)
- **Do** use `mt-auto border-t pt-3.5` inside a `Tile` to pin the optional secondary fact to the tile's bottom: the tile is already a flex column and the grid cell stretches it (`[&>section]:flex-1`), so nothing else is required — the `<Card>` + `CardContent h-full` form of the same idea is superseded (see **Card Sticky Footer**).
- **Do** use `rounded-[2px]` for chart legend color swatches (color keys). Use `rounded-full` for inline dot indicators (row bullets, status dots). The distinction is semantic: square = color key, circle = inline marker.
- **Do** lay out a row of same-purpose, different-length chips as a grid (`grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 tablet:grid-cols-2`), not `flex-wrap`, so every chip shares the same column width without any JS measurement — see **The Equal-Column Chip Rule**. Full-width chip rows only: inside a tile the chips are grouped (**The Grouped Chip Rule**), as on the Panoramica and Patrimonio since 2026-08-22.
- **Do** duplicate responsive blocks with `desktop:hidden` / `hidden desktop:grid` when the same data must be positioned differently across breakpoints (e.g. TER + cost metrics in the hero card footer on desktop, as standalone cards below the hero on mobile). Redundant DOM is preferable to a convoluted single implementation that degrades at both sizes.
- **Do** put a gap on the basis of the figure it stands beside (**The Same-Basis Rule**), and name the window a figure was measured on — the picker's label is a request, the subject of the sentence is what the data delivered.
- **Do** put a control that classifies without measuring — a rebalance band, a threshold — in the aside of the tile whose reading it qualifies, and keep the measurement it does not move beside the classification it does (**The Scope-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule**).
- **Do** draw today on a budget's track (**Budget Track**): a used share means nothing until it is read against the calendar's share of the same window, and the reading line says the gap in points.
- **Do** give a modal the tile's anatomy and the Float shadow (**The Modal-Is-A-Tile Rule**): eyebrow · title at 20px · reading · body · footer, on `bg-card` at 16px radius, at one of the four named widths.
- **Do** let a modal's reading be its status line — one stable `role="status"` node that is also Radix's `Description` — and say a failure in the product's own words through `describeWriteError`, never the SDK's.
- **Do** arm a destructive primary instead of asking it: two clicks, no timer, the label naming the count from the same query the reading counts, and Escape refused at the modal's `onEscapeKeyDown` while anything is armed.
- **Do** use inverted sign semantics (parameterized `positiveGood: boolean`) for expense delta annotations. A positive Spese delta means spending increased — the color should be `text-destructive`, opposite to the income logic. Never hardcode positive-as-green (raw `text-green-*`) in components that handle both income and expense metrics; use the `text-positive` / `text-destructive` tokens so the sign colors follow the theme.

- **Do** take an out-of-DOM colour from `lib/constants/printTokens.ts` (**The Out-Of-DOM Token Rule**): an email and a PDF have no cascade, so the hex is the token, and every one of them must be the sRGB rendering of a declaration in `globals.css`.
- **Do** name the window a figure is measured over when it is not the one the surface is titled after (**The Declared-Window Rule**): a "Totale" export that floors the cashflow at 2025 says so, and an email sent on Sunday says that none of its numbers are weekly.
- **Do** lay an email out in nested tables with percentage widths. Outlook on Windows renders through Word: flexbox and grid do not exist there, and a card that relies on them collapses.
- **Do** generate the email's opening sentence from rules and put the AI comment under it. The comment's generation is non-blocking by design, so a message that opens on it opens on nothing whenever the model is unavailable.

### Don't:

- **Don't** let a generated sentence blame or credit something the data does not show (The Narrative Honesty Rule). A falling month with a positive market effect is "nonostante il mercato", never "il mercato ha pesato"; a missing input drops its clause rather than printing a placeholder.
- **Don't** put a made-up figure on a tile that could show none, and don't type a fact about the tool into copy when a module already owns it (**The Sample-Data Rule**). The landing's «6 classi di asset» stayed on screen for the ten days after the union grew to eight, and the product document cited that very line as an example of an honest surface.
- **Don't** repeat a tile's rows in another tile. The Cashflow tile lost its top-3 categories the moment "Spese per categoria" existed.
- **Don't** list a projected overrun beside a crossed threshold, nor colour a budget under its limit with the positive token (The Risk-vs-Fact Rule, the Sign-Color Token Rule): a risk is a projection, a fact is spending, and «under budget» is not a gain.
- **Don't** colour an amount dated in the future with a sign token, nor let a figure that includes it pass without saying so (The Scheduled-Is-Not-Spent Rule): a spesa in calendario is not a loss until it happens, and a total that carries one owes the reader the amount, the horizon **and the fact that the amount is INSIDE the total**. The third is not optional: «spese 2910 €. In calendario ci sono ancora 1850 €» gives amount and horizon and still reads as an addition to 4760 — the clause has to open on «Nel totale» and close on «già in calendario». And «dated in the future» means a later calendar DAY: a row saved an hour ago carries a creation time, so an instant comparison chips what the reader just spent.
- **Don't** ask for a value the save path will overwrite. When an instalment plan declares its own total, the generic amount field is REMOVED, not disabled: a required field whose value is silently replaced is a lie the form tells (Form Follows Function — honesty).
- **Don't** print an annualised gap beside a period return, nor «oggi» on a window that closes before the latest snapshot (The Same-Basis Rule): a reader takes the two figures as one comparison.
- **Don't** colour a whole verdict headline by tone. The full stop carries the tone; the figures carry their signs; the words stay `text-foreground`.
- **Don't** format a percentage with `toFixed` in user-facing copy — the dot decimal is not Italian (The Comma Rule).
- **Don't** colour a drift, a gap to target or a plan amount with the sign tokens, nor let a page's verdict follow a tile's toggle (The Scope-Is-Not-An-Axis Rule): the action hues belong to the chips, and the verdict reads one fixed answer.
- **Don't** give a verdict to a row that has no target, and don't let its value vanish either (**The Untargeted-Row Rule**, 2026-08-30). Allocazione's «Senza sottocategoria» holds real money against no plan: printed with a 0% target it would take a VENDI chip and a gap the size of itself, telling the reader to sell what they only need to classify. It prints its share and its value, keeps `text-muted-foreground`, drops the chip, the gap column and the target tick, and sorts LAST — it is what is LEFT of the class, so it must not sit between two verdicts. Removing the row instead is the worse error: the sleeves then fail to reach 100% and nothing on screen says why.
- **Don't** paint a modal `bg-background`, nor put a second exit next to «Annulla» in the footer's own register, nor let a caller branch on the viewport to order two buttons (**The Modal-Is-A-Tile Rule**). A surface the colour of the page it floats over is lifted off nothing, and in light mode `--card` and `--background` are the same pure white — the border and the Float shadow are what separate it there.
- **Don't** give a destructive confirm a countdown, and don't stack three full-width buttons of different consequence in one footer: the CHOICE belongs in the body, the footer carries one primary that names what it will do.
- **Don't** put a made-up model name, a provider error string or an «N/D» in a modal: a fact about the tool is read from the module that owns it, a failure is translated, and a metric that cannot be computed loses its row.
- **Don't** give the chrome a second label size. A 12px group label next to 10px tile eyebrows reads as two systems; the frame borrows the content's eyebrow (The One-Eyebrow Rule).
- **Don't** ship a touch target under 44px in the icon rail or the phone drawer — a 28px options button is a desktop affordance that landed on a phone.
- **Don't** pin a page to "no scroll". Density is the goal; a third row below the fold is fine, a tile squeezed until its numbers wrap is not.
- **Don't** shape an element for appearance alone. A larger number, a heavier shadow, a brighter accent, or an extra animation that exists "to look good" violates form-follows-function. If a property carries no function, it is decoration — cut it. And never fake what isn't there: no false depth, no invented material, no shadow hierarchy a surface hasn't earned (the honesty corollary).
- **Don't** add brand color to the default theme's surface chrome (backgrounds, cards, buttons). Zero-chroma is the rule: color belongs to data, not decoration.
- **Don't** model density after a Bloomberg terminal. Dense presentation serves the user; illegibility or emotional coldness does not.
- **Don't** use consumer fintech color patterns — colorful fills, playful gradients, bright accents on every interactive element. This tool handles serious long-term wealth management.
- **Don't** apply Material Design component conventions. Generic patterns that serve any app serve this one poorly.
- **Don't** use gradient text (`background-clip: text` with a gradient fill). Use weight or size for emphasis.
- **Don't** use side-stripe borders (colored `border-left` greater than 1px as a card accent). Rewrite with full borders, background tints, or leading icons instead.
- **Don't** use glassmorphism (`backdrop-filter: blur`) decoratively. A blurred surface must be structurally justified.
- **Don't** use proportional figures for financial numbers in tabular contexts. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` or `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1` is required wherever numbers appear in column-aligned positions.
- **Don't** add shadows larger than Lift to in-document cards. Float shadow creates false depth hierarchy when applied to surfaces that haven't left document flow.
- **Don't** nest cards inside cards (box-within-box). If a list of items lives inside a Card container, the rows are flat — no individual card per item.
- **Don't** use progress bars to communicate allocation or weight unless the visual fill carries information the number alone cannot convey. A dominant `font-mono` value + label is almost always clearer.
- **Don't** give equal visual weight to multiple values when one is the primary takeaway. Apply the Dominant Value Block: one number commands, the rest are context.
- **Don't** use `lg:` (1024px) as a layout breakpoint for wide-screen changes. iPad Mini in landscape is 1024px and receives the mobile treatment by design. Use `desktop:` (1440px) for all layout switches.
- **Don't** design the desktop version first and then adapt it for mobile. Mobile layout is the base; desktop adds columns, tables, and sidebar — it does not simplify a desktop original.
- **Don't** use `bg-card` for sub-items nested inside a Card. Sub-tiles inside a card must use `bg-muted` — the card background repeated creates a card-within-card violation even when the inner element has no explicit `<Card>` wrapper.
- **Don't** place count-up animation logic (`useCountUp`, `rAF` loops) in a page-level component. Every frame tick re-renders the entire tree. Animation state belongs in a dedicated leaf component.
- **Don't** render a ring or donut chart with `strokeLinecap="round"` when the segment can be near 0% or near 100% — the round caps visually overlap the track ring and distort the reading. Use `strokeLinecap="butt"` for data-accurate arcs.
- **Don't** use `rounded-full` for chart legend swatches (CompositionList/CompositionBar rows). At 8×8px, a circle reads as a traffic-light dot (status indicator), not as a color key. `rounded-[2px]` reads as a color sample. The distinction is visually meaningful.
- **Don't** reach for a pie/donut chart to compare magnitudes across 6+ items. Pie angles are hard to compare; aligned bar lengths aren't. Use `CompositionList` (ranked rows) for "which items are biggest" or `CompositionBar` (stacked bar) for "what does the whole composition look like" — reserve pie/donut for genuine part-of-whole reads with ≤5 slices and information a flat row can't carry (see CompositionList and CompositionBar above).
- **Don't** use an animated SVG donut or ring chart when flat `divide-y` rows carry the same information more clearly. Chrome reduction is the primary principle — the animated donut in the Liquid card was replaced by a flat 3-row breakdown precisely because the breakdown communicates more (three separate values, individual percentages) with less visual noise.
- **Don't** use placeholder bars (e.g. dummy `width: 0` category bars) when no data is available. Omit the block entirely — absence communicates "no data" more cleanly than empty chrome.
- **Don't** enter the skeleton on a failed query (`loading || !data` is the collapse that produces a skeleton which never lifts), and don't let a failed read fall through to the empty branch — the alert comes first.
- **Don't** draw an illustration for an empty state, and don't drop the eyebrow: the tile's question must stay visible precisely when the tile cannot answer it.

- **Don't** write a hex inline in an email template or a PDF section. It cannot follow a token, nothing in the build can notice when it drifts, and two years of that is how the emails ended up on a slate ramp and the report on a blue accent.
- **Don't** print a typographic minus in a PDF. WinAnsi has no U+2212 and `@react-pdf/renderer` drops it silently, turning `−620 €` into `620 €` — the same figure with the opposite meaning. `pdfSafeText` converts it at the boundary.
- **Don't** let one sentence mix two windows. A reading that takes its endpoints from the filtered series and its delta from the whole history prints three numbers that cannot all be true.
