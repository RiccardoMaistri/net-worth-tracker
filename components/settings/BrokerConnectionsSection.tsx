/**
 * Broker connections — the «Collegamenti» tab: read-only sync from the brokers this app speaks to.
 *
 * Two providers, two components, one rule: a sync only ever READS. Scalable goes through the `sc`
 * CLI on the hosting machine and can be rebuilt from pasted JSON when the binary is missing;
 * Trade Republic is reached over HTTP with a session this server holds. Neither writes to the
 * broker, and each says so in its own tile.
 *
 * The providers are siblings rather than a switch inside one component: the shared part is a
 * `Tile` with a reading, a preview and a save, and everything else — how the session is obtained,
 * what the payload contains, which figures can be written — differs per broker. Folding them into
 * one file produced a 700-line component with a `broker ===` in every branch.
