/**
 * Authentication gate for the dashboard PAGES — not for the shell around them.
 *
 * Since 2026-09-28 the dashboard layout renders the skip link, the sidebar, `<main>` and the bottom
 * nav unconditionally, so they are in the prerendered HTML and on screen before Firebase Auth has
 * resolved; this component sits INSIDE `<main>` and gates only the page. Three states:
 * 1. Loading — render `fallback` (the layout passes the generic tile-grid skeleton: the wait is a
 *    WAIT and takes the primitive every page uses, DESIGN.md → The Absence-Has-Three-Names Rule).
 *    On the server `loading` is always true, so the fallback is what the HTML carries. The same
 *    fallback also covers the restore of the persisted query cache (`useIsRestoring`).
 * 2. Not authenticated — keep the fallback on screen and redirect in an effect: the beat between
 *    the verdict and the navigation shows the same skeleton, not an empty `main`.
 * 3. Authenticated — render the page.
 *
 * Race condition prevention: the redirect checks `!loading && !user` (never before Auth has
 * answered) and runs in `useEffect`, not during render.
