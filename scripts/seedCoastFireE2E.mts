/**
 * Deterministic Coast FIRE fixture for the Playwright suite.
 *
 * Run via `npm run e2e:seed:coast`, and from Playwright's global setup AFTER the Previdenza
 * fixture — it needs `e2e-pension-fund` to already exist for the unlock inflow to have a subject.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE, not a block inside `seedPensionE2E.mts`
 * That script is scoped to what the Previdenza view reads. This one writes only Coast FIRE
 * *settings*, on the same `assetAllocationTargets/test-user-1` document, with `merge: true` so
 * neither fixture can wipe the other's fields.
 *
 * WHY CUSTOM EXPENSES AND NOT THE CASHFLOW FALLBACK
 * `getAnnualExpenses` reads the LAST COMPLETE year, and the base seed writes current-month
 * expenses only — so without an explicit figure the Coast projection is null and the tab renders
 * its empty state. `coastFireCustomExpenses` also removes the run-month dependency the FIRE tab
 * has (doc/guide/e2e-emulatori.md § Browser-Driven E2E (Playwright)): the expenses side of every Coast figure is then fixed.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS RUN-DATE DEPENDENT (deliberately, hence structural assertions in the spec)
 * Each pension's start date is an absolute date, so `yearsUntilStart` — and with it the deflation
 * applied to the gross amount — shifts by one day per day. The spec asserts shape and format;
 * exact arithmetic belongs to `__tests__/fireService.test.ts`.
