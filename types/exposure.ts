/**
 * Esposizione — the shapes shared by its three layers (2026-09-28, doc/guide/allocazione.md § Esposizione):
 *
 *  - what the browser ASKS: `ProfileRequest` (a ticker and the Yahoo module its type needs),
 *    selected by `lib/utils/exposureRequests.ts` from the assets the page already holds;
 *  - what the route ANSWERS: `InstrumentProfile`, ONLY what Yahoo said about a ticker, per module,
 *    served from the shared `instrument-profile-cache/{ticker}` (`lib/server/exposure/*`);
 *  - what the engine COMPUTES: `PortfolioExposure`, four views weighed in the browser on the
 *    page's own assets (`lib/utils/exposureEngine.ts`).
 *
 * Two rules the types enforce by shape. A profile carries NOTHING of the user's — no asset name,
 * no class, no composition — because the cache document is shared by every account: the label of
 * a direct stock is Yahoo's `longName`, else the ticker. And every euro of a view's base has a
 * named destiny (read · unread · not applicable · out of this view), so the coverage line can say
 * where each one went and the list can add up to 100 on screen.
