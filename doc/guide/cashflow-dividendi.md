## Files

Moved here from `CLAUDE.md` → *Key Files* on 2026-09-19.

- **Dividendi**: `components/dividends/DividendTrackingTab.tsx` + `tiles/*` + `DividendiDettaglio.tsx`, pure `lib/utils/{dividendAnalytics,dividendiNarrative,dividendEligibility}.ts` (`resolveDividendFloor` = the ONE floor under a scraped dividend), `lib/hooks/useDividendStats.ts` → `app/api/dividends/stats/route.ts`; registry and coupons `components/dividends/{DividendTable,DividendCalendar,DividendDialog,DividendDetailsDialog,DividendRecordDetailsDialog,InflationRateDialog,ProvisionalCouponBanner}.tsx`, `lib/utils/couponUtils.ts` (`resolveCoupon` for both mechanisms, `resolveInflationIndexation`, `hasCouponPayments`, the coefficient lookups), `lib/services/couponScheduling.ts`, `types/dividend.ts`

## Cashflow › Dividendi (`components/dividends/DividendTrackingTab.tsx`, `components/dividends/tiles/*`)
- **RECEIVED AND ANNOUNCED ARE NEVER ONE FIGURE.** A dividend whose `paymentDate` is in the future is
  a promise, not income: it is counted, totalled and coloured apart on every surface — its own chip in
  the hero, two `tfoot` rows in the table, a muted amount and an «Attesa» badge in the row, a fainter
  wash in the calendar cell, its own subtotal in the day dialog, its own clause in every reading.
  `summarizePayments` returns the two halves and no sum; there is deliberately no "total" field to reach for.
- **ONE period axis, and the announced money is ON it.** `DividendPeriod` (Mese | Anno | 12 mesi |
  Storico) sits beside the verdict from `desktop:`. `resolvePeriodBounds` is the ONE window — upper
  bound = the end of the period's own unit, **not today** — and everything reads it:
  `filterPaidByPeriod` = in-window AND paid (the income figures), `sliceForList` = in-window
  (the list, received and announced alike), the hero's «già annunciati» chip and its «Prossimi
  pagamenti» footer, and the calendar's navigation clamp. The first cut left announced rows
  unbounded and it showed: a BTP final premium dated 2032 sat in the «agosto» list, and the chip
  printed 127 € beside a list holding one 57 € coupon. *An unscoped figure beside a scoped one is
  two windows in one tile.* The instrument/type filters narrow only the list; never route a tile
  through the filtered list.
- **The verdict's «il prossimo stacco è …» is the ONLY deliberately unscoped clause**, because it
  names an instrument AND a date and therefore states its own scope. When the period holds no
  announced money the sentence drops the total and keeps the date («Nessun pagamento incassato ad
  agosto; il prossimo stacco è ENI il 15 settembre.») — never «0 € sono annunciati».
- **The calendar cannot browse out of the window** (`bounds` prop): the arrows stop at its edges and
  are not rendered at all when the window IS one month — the picker is that axis, and an arrow
  leading to a month the slice cannot fill would present an empty month as a fact.
- **The Rendimento tile does NOT follow the axis, and says so.** YOC, current yield (TTM on the
  current holding) and DPS growth (closed calendar years) are the server's; the picker cannot change
  them. The aside reads «ultimi 12 mesi» and `describeYieldFooter` states the base. Generalise: *a
  tile measured on a window other than the page's axis must name its window, not pretend to follow.*
- **`useDividendStats` carries NO date bounds.** They only ever narrowed `periodStats`, a block the
  tab now derives in memory, while `yieldOnCostAssets`, `totalReturnAssets` and `dividendGrowthData`
  are TTM/all-time by construction — so the bounds bought nothing and cost a refetch per click, and
  they let a period change silently move figures that are not on the period axis. One query per owner.
  It also no longer follows the asset filter: that is the list's filter, not the portfolio's.
- **Every number is born in `lib/utils/dividendAnalytics.ts`** (`rankPayerShares`, `summarizeYearlyIncome`,
  `nextPayments`, `summarizePayments`, `resolveMonthlyWindow`, `buildCoverageMonths`, `summarizeYield`,
  `summarizeDpsGrowth`, `summarizeTotalReturn`, `sliceForList`), every sentence in `dividendiNarrative.ts`.
  `rankPayers`/`MAX_RANKED_PAYERS`/`buildMonthlyNetSeries`/`periodToDateBounds`/`computeUpcomingNet`
  were retired with the redesign — `rankPayerShares` is the ONE payer ranking and it carries the
  residual row the tiles need, and announced money is only ever counted on the period's window.
- **The running window is drawn but never ranked.** The current calendar year is a soft, outlined bar
  in «Per anno» and is out of the average, the best/worst and the reading — at the end of August a year
  two thirds done would be the worst year by construction. "Already passed the best closed year" IS a
  fact, so the sentence says it. Same rule as Tracciamento's running month.
- **A window it cannot draw is not drawn at all.** `buildCoverageMonths` returns `[]` past `maxMonths`
  (24): five years of coverage as sixty squares is not a reading, and a slice of the window under a KPI
  measured on the whole of it would put two windows in one tile.
- **Italian grammar is data.** `LARGEST_TYPE_PREFIX` gives each `DividendType` its article («la cedola»,
  «l'acconto», «il premio finale») and gives an ordinary dividend NO prefix — a list of dividends does
  not need to say "dividendo". Percentages go through `articleForPercent`/`ofThePercent`. The collaudo
  caught «il ordinario» exactly because the prefix was once built with string concatenation.
- **The two page-level actions talk through window events** (`cashflow:add-dividend`,
  `cashflow:scrape-dividends`), like Tracciamento's `cashflow:add-expense`: the header dispatches, the
  tab owns the dialogs. The header's buttons are desktop-only — on a phone the add button sits beside
  the period axis and is the ONLY add affordance there, since the bottom-nav FAB belongs to
  Tracciamento, and «Scarica storico» sits in the Pagamenti toolbar beside «Esporta CSV» (2026-09-14;
  four period labels and two 44px squares did not fit 390).
- **The list is a table where a table is right, and flat rows elsewhere.** `DividendTable` keeps the
  sortable grid from `desktop:` inside the tile (sub-eyebrow headers with `scope`, `th scope="row"`,
  13px mono cells, `-mx-5 px-5` scroll so it never takes the page with it) and becomes a `divide-y`
  list of buttons below it — a card per row inside a tile is a card inside a card. Its page is stored
  WITH the list length it was opened under, never reset in an effect.
- **The calendar has no card of its own**: the cell hairlines are the frame, and clicking a day opens
  its dialog. It no longer cross-filters the list (`focusedDate` is gone): with the calendar on screen
  the narrowed list it produced was invisible. Its month is stored WITH the period window it was
  browsed under (`boundsKey`), so a switch of the axis lands on today's month, and the 42 cells are a
  roving tabindex the arrows walk (2026-09-14).
- **TWO POPULATIONS, BOTH NAMED (2026-09-14, the owner's call).** The verdict, the hero and the
  inventory read the REGISTRY: every payment of the period, sold instruments included, because the
  income was real («Nel 2026 hai incassato 300 € netti da 3 strumenti»). Affidabilità and Chi paga di
  più answer in the present tense («posso contare su questo reddito?»), so they measure the
  instruments STILL HELD — `computeReliability` and `rankPayerShares` take `heldAssetIds` (the page's
  assets with `quantity > 0`) — and name what the sold ones paid in their own clause: the reading
  («altri 186 € da 2 strumenti venduti»), the residual row («2 strumenti venduti», so the shares still
  add up to the aside's total, which stays the period's), the footer (`describeSoldIncomeNote`) and,
  when every payer was sold, the empty copy of Affidabilità. On the owner's mirror «Concentrazione
  alta: SPM.MI vale il 47% del netto» was a risk warning on a stock already sold. The window's length
  never follows the subset: two months paid out of nine is «2 su 9», not «2 su 2».
- **The verdict's yield clause names its window and its population.** «; l'unico strumento con costo
  medio rende l'1,3% lordo sul costo negli ultimi 12 mesi» (or «; i 7 strumenti con costo medio
  rendono …»): the figure is TTM on the held instruments with a cost basis, off the period axis, and
  until 2026-09-14 it read «; rendono l'1,3%» right after «da 3 strumenti» — identical in all four
  periods. In `describeYield` two yields that print the same are «in linea con il valore di mercato»,
  never «contro l'1,3%». A one-month window says «nell'unico mese del periodo» (no «i 1 mesi»), and a
  «Prossimi pagamenti» row outside the current year prints its year (`describeUpcomingDate`).
- **The form (`DividendDialog`) is in the modal vocabulary** (doc/guide/dialog.md): the reading is the
  status line (`describeDividendIntent` idle, `describeFormRefusal` on a refused submit with
  `aria-invalid` and the focus on the first refused field in READING order — `shouldFocusError: false`,
  or react-hook-form moves it to the first registered one and skips the combobox), the submit is never
  `disabled`, a failed write speaks `describeWriteError` there, a duplicate (`skipped`) says so instead of
  closing. The picker lists every instrument of an equity or bonds class that is not a pension fund,
  an account or a house, held or sold («· venduto»), plus the record's own instrument on an edit; it
  stays mounted while the assets load (disabled). The withholding proposal is the instrument's own
  `taxRate` over the gross per unit, on a new record and an untouched field only; a bond's payment
  defaults to «Cedola». The summary is a `bg-muted` block in the mono face with no sign colour.
- **The row is reachable and its delete arms in place.** The instrument's name in the desktop table
  is a `<button>` («Dettagli: la cedola di BTP del 10/09/2026») that opens the record and receives the
  focus back (`returnFocusTo`); the two actions name their record; the delete is `useArmedDelete`
  (no timer): «Conferma» in words AND in the accessible name («Premi di nuovo per eliminare …»),
  `describeDividendDeleteConsequence` printed in the row (it says «e dal Cashflow» when a booked
  expense goes with it), one live region per table. A phone has NO delete for a payment (the record
  drawer edits; a spec that plants a row on the `mobile` project removes it through the REST API).
- **«Annunciato» is a word on every surface**: the «Attesa»/«Provvisoria» chips are on the desktop
  `<th>` AND the phone's row; the phone's list closes on the two totals; the calendar's announced day
  carries a `--warning-border` hairline and the word «attesa» under its amount. Its name to a reader is
  «10 dicembre 2026 — 1 pagamento in attesa».
- **Nothing recorded is one tile, not five zeros**: with `dividends.length === 0` the grid is a single
  «Pagamenti» tile with the `EmptyState` sentence and the two actions (add, scrape); the axis is not
  rendered. A failed `useDividendStats` read is said in place of the Dettaglio (`ErrorNotice compact`)
  and inside Rendimento with the «Lettura fallita» eyebrow, never an empty space.
- **The type labels are the readings' words**: «Acconto» and «Saldo» (`dividendTypeLabels`), the one
  map the select, the table and the two detail dialogs read — the article map `LARGEST_TYPE_PREFIX`
  and `dividendTypeNoun` («la cedola», «il dividendo») live in `dividendiNarrative.ts`.

## Dividends and Coupons
- **A payment credits a cash account — per instrument, then a default** (2026-09-20, `lib/utils/dividendAccount.ts`).
  `Asset.dividendCashAssetId` (the asset form, only for `paysDividends` types: stock/etf/bond — two brokers, two
  accounts) wins over the setting `dividendCashAssetId` (Impostazioni › Dividendi); neither → the income row moves
  nothing, as before. **Only a payment whose Italian day is today or later when its row is created credits**
  (`isPaymentDueOrAhead`, owner's decision): the scrape and the coupon catch-up bring in up to 370 days of arrears the
  balance already holds. `createExpenseFromDividend` resolves the account ITSELF (no caller can forget it; an arrear
  costs no read) and writes the row, the balance and the dividend's `expenseId` in ONE transaction — the cron is
  idempotent on `expenseId`, so a row without its link would be credited again. The row is an ordinary linked income
  row (no `balancePending`: applied), so Tracciamento's edits and deletes give the account back through
  `lib/utils/cashSettlement.ts`; `updateExpenseFromDividend` moves the DIFFERENCE and `deleteExpenseForDividend` gives
  back what was applied. The amount is cents (`dividendIncomeAmount`); an account that is not the user's own cash
  account, or is in another currency than the row, is skipped and the row written without a link.
- **A route reads settings and categories with the ADMIN SDK** (`resolveDividendIncomeCategory`, 2026-09-20): the
  dividend PUT route used the client readers (`getSettings`, `getCategoryById`), which the rules refuse with no
  signed-in client, and its `catch` swallowed the refusal — an edited dividend NEVER reached its income row. Found by
  the emulator exercise reading the row back (AGENTS.md § Audit habits: a fire-and-forget is verified by reading the
  document it should have written).
- **A coupon's cashflow expense is created only by the daily cron on payment date, never at asset-save time**
  (`createDividendWithOptionalExpense` gates on `!isAutoGenerated`; cron Phase 2 is idempotent via `expenseId`).
  Corollary: `deleteUpcomingCouponsForAsset`/`deleteUpcomingFinalPremiumForAsset` must batch-delete the linked expense.
- **The coupon cron is self-healing, not exact-day**: Phases 2-3 query a 370-day lookback and Phase 3 walks
  `getFollowingCouponDate` forward, so a missed run cannot stop the chain.
- **Adding a `DividendType` is a six-file fan-out** and nothing enforces it: `types/dividend.ts`, `DividendTable`,
  `DividendDetailsDialog`, `DividendTrackingTab`, `DividendDialog`, plus `dividendService.ts`'s `byType` initializer.
- **A coupon's tax rate is the asset's own `taxRate`** (12,5% government, 26% corporate), never a constant.
- **YOC and Current Yield share one pure function**, `computeDividendYieldMetrics`, prospective and per-share:
  `annualizedDPS = Σ(grossEur/div.quantity)` annualized, YOC = `DPS ÷ averageCost`, Current Yield = `DPS ÷ price`, only
  `quantity > 0` contributing. Never reintroduce an inline YOC in Rendimenti or `/api/dividends/stats`.
- **YOC, Current Yield and per-asset Total Return are scoped to the CURRENT holding** (`createAsset` re-links by ISIN, so
  dividends before `holdingStartDate` are dropped, with `deriveHoldingStartDates` for legacy rebuys). **DPS growth is
  deliberately NOT scoped** — it is a security-level payout history.
- **A scraped dividend has ONE floor** (`lib/utils/dividendEligibility.ts`, 2026-09-13): the holding start from the
  ledger when there is one, else the asset's creation date — shared by `/api/dividends/scrape` and cron Phase 1. A
  floor is never silent: the route returns `filtered`, `floorDate` and `floorSource`, and «Scarica dividendi storici»
  toasts `describeFilteredDividends` — how many were dropped and, when a floor was the creation date, the recovery
  (record the purchase in the Registro operazioni with its real date and scrape again). Until then the button said
  «Nessun nuovo dividendo trovato» for every stock added to the app after its dividends, which read as «none exist».
- **The floor's two sources, by field name** (moved here from the `AGENTS.md` stub on 2026-09-20): a scraped dividend
  has ONE floor (`lib/utils/dividendEligibility.ts`: `holdingStartDate` from the ledger, else `createdAt`), shared by
  `/api/dividends/scrape` and cron Phase 1 — and never silent: the route returns `filtered`/`floorDate`/`floorSource`
  and the tab toasts `describeFilteredDividends` with the recovery (2026-09-13).
- **Received metrics filter on `paymentDate`, not `exDate`**; use `setHours(23,59,59,999)` for the upper bound, or a
  `…T00:00:00Z` dividend reads as future.
- **Two inflation mechanisms, ONE field** (`BondDetails.inflationIndexation`, read only through
  `resolveInflationIndexation`, which maps the legacy `isInflationLinked: true` to `italia`; the flag is never written
  any more). **`italia` (BTP Italia) is additive**: the FOI rate is already per-period, deflation is floored to 0, the
  capital redeems at par. **`euro` (BTP€i, issue #341, 2026-09-11) is multiplicative**: coupon = real rate per period ×
  the HICP indexation coefficient at the payment date × nominal; the revaluation accrues in the coefficient and is
  cashed at maturity, never with the coupon — no minimum coupon, no loyalty premium. Both are resolved by
  `resolveCoupon`/`buildCouponNote` for the client scheduler (`scheduleNextCoupon`), `InflationRateDialog` and cron
  Phase 3. An unannounced coupon is stored **provisional**: at the fixed floor for `italia`, at the LATEST KNOWN
  coefficient for `euro` (par when none — the note says which). The coefficients live in
  `bondDetails.indexationCoefficients` (`{ date, coefficient }[]`, keyed by calendar DAY: `findIndexationCoefficient`
  takes the coupon's day, else the latest of its month; `latestIndexationCoefficient(entries, asOf)` feeds the
  valuation and the provisional estimate; `upsertIndexationCoefficient` replaces the same day only). The dialog that
  finalises a provisional coupon is ONE component for both mechanisms (`InflationRateDialog`: FOI % or coefficient,
  copy from `MECHANISM_COPY`), and the banner/button say «dato d'inflazione», never «tasso FOI».
- **A zero-coupon bond (rate 0) saves its details and materialises nothing** (issue #340): `buildBondDetailsFromForm`
  (`lib/utils/bondDetailsForm.ts`, pure, tested against the real function) treats only an EMPTY rate as missing, and
  `scheduleNextCoupon` returns `{ scheduled: false }` through `hasCouponPayments` (rate 0 and no positive tier). Cron
  Phase 3 never sees such a bond: it walks from an existing coupon.
- **Redemption at maturity is not an event, for any bond**: a matured bond keeps its last price until the user sells it
  in the Registro; for a BTP€i the final `nominal × coefficient` is therefore recorded as that sale, never generated.
- **`/api/dividends/stats` returns the NET yields too** (`portfolioYieldOnCostNet`,
  `portfolioCurrentYieldGross/Net`): `computeDividendYieldMetrics` has always produced them and the
  route used to drop them, which forced every consumer wanting a net figure to re-derive it from an
  average tax rate. `averageYield` stays only as the deprecated alias of the gross current yield.
- **The date bounds of that route only ever narrowed `periodStats`.** `yieldOnCostAssets`,
  `totalReturnAssets` and `dividendGrowthData` are TTM/all-time whatever is passed — do not add a
  range expecting them to move (§ Cashflow › Dividendi).
- **Per-type badge colours are gone** (`dividendTypeBadgeColor` deleted): six literal Tailwind palettes
  stayed the same hue on every theme and made the type the loudest thing in a list about money. Type is
  plain text on a neutral outline; only `--warning*` colours anything there (announced / provisional).
- **Persist a bondDetails-only change with `updateAssetBondDetails`, never `updateAsset`** (which `deleteField()`s an
  absent `averageCost`/`taxRate`), passing the COMPLETE object — `updateDoc` replaces the whole map.

## Per-page blind spots

- **A coupon recovered the day after a missed cron is NOT credited to its account** — by the owner's rule (only a
  payment dated today or later credits, so arrears never count twice). The income row is there, without an account:
  adjust the balance by hand or link the row from Tracciamento.
- **Dividendi**: the payments table dropped *Tax/Netto/Costo per azione*; the calendar day opens the day dialog instead of filtering; under «Mese» no month arrows, under «Anno» they stop at January/December; the list toolbar is rendered twice (desktop and phone, one hidden). The yield never follows the period (TTM on the current holding); the DPS running-year column is a partial sum; no `averageCost` → the tile becomes an explanation. Since 2026-09-14: Chi paga di più ranks only the HELD payers while its aside's total is the whole period's (the «venduti» row closes the gap); the verdict's «da 3 strumenti» counts sold payers too, on purpose; an edit form opens with the picker focused and its list open (Radix focuses the first field); a phone has no delete for a payment; the Dividendi axis options are `radio`, not `tab`, in a spec.
- **YOC/Current Yield** exclude sold assets and are scoped to the current holding via `holdingStartDate`; a sell+rebuy inside one month counts the prior holding's dividends against the new cost basis (an overstated YOC, never a regression). (moved from `CLAUDE.md` → Known Issues on 2026-09-19)
