# Persisted query cache

> **When to open this guide** — anyone touching `lib/constants/persistCache.ts` (`PERSISTED_QUERY_PREFIXES`, `PERSIST_CACHE_VERSION`, the retention, the throttle, the rollback flag), `lib/query/queryPersister.ts`, `lib/query/persistedQueryDefaults.ts` (`applyPersistedQueryDefaults`), `lib/providers/QueryClientProvider.tsx` (`SignOutCacheGuard`, the restore's invalidation), `lib/utils/queryPersistence.ts` (dates across the store), `lib/utils/demoAccount.ts` (`isDemoUid`), `lib/query/queryKeys.ts` (the owner's uid right after a persisted prefix), a read hook in `lib/hooks/`, `ProtectedRoute` (`useIsRestoring()`) or `useFreshness` — or anyone who renames, removes or retypes a field of a persisted payload. `AGENTS.md` keeps the stub in § Caching; here is the full rule. Files: § *Files* below. What the reader sees («Aggiornato alle…») is `doc/guide/stati.md § The fourth reading`. Exercised by `e2e/freshness.spec.ts`, `__tests__/persistCache.test.ts`, `__tests__/persistedQueryDefaults.test.ts`, `__tests__/queryPersistence.test.ts` and `__tests__/freshness.test.ts`.

## Files

Moved here from `AGENTS.md` § Caching on 2026-09-30.

- **The persister**: `lib/constants/persistCache.ts` (`PERSISTED_QUERY_PREFIXES`, `PERSIST_CACHE_VERSION`, `PERSIST_CACHE_MAX_AGE_MS`, `PERSIST_CACHE_THROTTLE_MS`, `isQueryPersistenceEnabled` = the rollback flag, `isPersistableQuery`), `lib/query/queryPersister.ts` (`createQueryPersister`, `clearPersistedQueries`), `lib/query/persistedQueryDefaults.ts` (`applyPersistedQueryDefaults`), `lib/providers/QueryClientProvider.tsx` (`SignOutCacheGuard`, the `onSuccess` invalidation, the plain-provider branch), `lib/utils/queryPersistence.ts` (`serializeForPersist`, `deserializeFromPersist`), `lib/query/queryKeys.ts` (the warning on the owner's uid)
- **The demo**: `lib/utils/demoAccount.ts` (`isDemoUid`), read by `lib/hooks/useDemoMode.ts` and by `isPersistableQuery` — doc/guide/account-condiviso-demo.md
- **The restore gate**: `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (`useIsRestoring()`)
- **The freshness reading**: `lib/hooks/useFreshness.ts`, `lib/utils/freshness.ts` (`resolveFreshness`, the «old» rule), `describeFreshness` in `lib/utils/statesNarrative.ts` — doc/guide/stati.md
- **Tests**: `__tests__/persistCache.test.ts`, `__tests__/persistedQueryDefaults.test.ts`, `__tests__/queryPersistence.test.ts`, `__tests__/freshness.test.ts`; `e2e/freshness.spec.ts` (Cashflow) and the reload test of `e2e/performance.degraded.spec.ts` (Rendimenti), over `e2e/freshnessProbe.ts` (a helper: what a load showed, what is on disk), and `e2e/persistedCache.ts` (a helper, not a spec: it strips the persisted database from the parked sessions)

## The React Query cache is persisted to IndexedDB and restored before the first fetch

(2026-09-29: `lib/constants/persistCache.ts`, `lib/query/queryPersister.ts`, `lib/providers/QueryClientProvider.tsx`).

### What is persisted, and what is out by design

- ONLY the keys of `PERSISTED_QUERY_PREFIXES` — the twelve owner collections read through the hooks of
  AGENTS.md § React Query and Derived State, plus the ledger's meta document Patrimonio gates its trades on — only
  successful reads, and NEVER the demo uid (`isDemoUid`, `lib/utils/demoAccount.ts`, the ONE rule `useDemoMode` reads
  too); out by design: the assistant, benchmarks/FX/ECB, the Esposizione's profiles, the budget history. Since
  2026-10-04 also Rendimenti's two COMPUTED payloads, `['performance', 'data', uid, cacheKey]` and
  `['performance', 'yields', uid, windows]` (the owner's decision): the metrics also live in `performance-cache/{uid}`,
  but that is a round trip, and with only the collections restored the reload painted a skeleton under «Aggiornato
  alle…». The metrics are named by the cache key of the inputs they were computed from, so restored inputs and
  restored metrics are one consistent pair; a new cache key leaves the old entry on disk until its 24 hours pass.
  Measured on the mirror (2026-10-04, one visit to Rendimenti): the metrics are ~40 KB and the yields ~3 KB of a
  136 KB record whose snapshots are 55.

### Retention: `maxAge` and `gcTime`

- `maxAge` 24 h, and the same 24 h as `gcTime` set PER PREFIX by `applyPersistedQueryDefaults` — the global ten
  minutes would drop an inactive query from the next save, and «riaprire dopo un'ora» would restore nothing; a hook
  never sets its own.

### The `PERSIST_CACHE_VERSION` bump rule

- **Bump `PERSIST_CACHE_VERSION` (the `buster`) on any change that RENAMES, REMOVES or retypes a field of a persisted
  payload** — everything under `PERSISTED_QUERY_PREFIXES`: an asset (the mortgage instalments under its key too), an
  expense, a snapshot, a category, the settings document, a contribution, a trade, the ledger's meta document, a cost
  centre, the Hall of Fame rankings, a goal, a receipt, the overview, Rendimenti's `PerformanceData` and its yields —
  or a client restores the old shape and reads it
  as truth until the refetch lands; a new optional field whose absence means the default does not need it.

### Dates by value

- Dates cross the store by VALUE (`lib/utils/queryPersistence.ts`: `Date`, a `Timestamp` and a bare
  `{ seconds, nanoseconds }` become one tagged ISO and come back a `Date`), never through a list of date fields per
  key.

### The three traps

Three traps, each paid for on 2026-09-29:

- during the restore every query is `pending` and NOT fetching, so `isLoading` is false and `data` undefined —
  `ProtectedRoute` holds the pages on the auth fallback until `useIsRestoring()` is false, and a surface mounted
  outside it must gate on that hook itself;
- the cache is forgotten at sign-out by the PROVIDER on the user→null transition (`SignOutCacheGuard`), never in the
  sign-out handler — a `clear()` under still-mounted hooks is rebuilt, refetched with the outgoing session and back on
  disk a second later (five keys, measured);
- and the persister writes on a one-second throttle whose FIRST call is immediate, so the record on disk can hold the
  settings alone while the expenses are still a second away (`e2e/freshness.spec.ts` polls for the key it needs).

### Rollback flag

- Rollback: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PERSIST_QUERIES=false` (never set on the Playwright server); the flag and the plain-provider
  branch stay until the release that carries the persister has run in production.

### Every load rereads what it restored

- **The restore INVALIDATES what it restored** (`onSuccess`, `refetchType: 'none'`): every load rereads,
  stale-while-revalidate — without it a reload within `staleTime` painted the restored figures and read nothing for
  five minutes (an Admin write between two `goto` stayed invisible to four specs).

### The freshness reading

- The reader is told when a figure from BEFORE this load is being reread — «Aggiornato alle 18:42, sto rileggendo…»
  in the page header, `useFreshness` + `describeFreshness`, «old» being `dataUpdatedAt < performance.timeOrigin` or
  older than the query's own `staleTime` — doc/guide/stati.md § The fourth reading.

## Per-page blind spots

- **Every window of the expenses is a payload of its own in the ONE record** (2026-09-30): after a tour of
  Tracciamento, Budget, Divisione, FIRE and Storico on the owner's mirror the record held six `expenses.*` keys, 4407
  rows and 2,2 MB (the whole collection once, 1547 rows and 0,8 MB, before the windows), and the auth wait that
  contains the restore rose on every page — measured on the Panoramica. The rows are the same rows several times:
  a window is a slice of the collection, not new data. Counting the keys of that record after a tour is part of
  giving a page a window (`doc/guide/cashflow.md § Expenses by window`); merging the slices into one list is not
  written. The deferred items of the persister's retirement review (one persisted record holding every key, the demo never seen in a browser) are in `doc/guide/velocita.md` § Revisit and `doc/guide/account-condiviso-demo.md` § Per-page blind spots.
