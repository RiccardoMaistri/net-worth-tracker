# Shell

> **When to open this guide** — anyone touching `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` (the shell outside `ProtectedRoute`, `<main>` = `page-main`), `app/dashboard/template.tsx` (the fallback fade), `components/layout/*` (`Sidebar`, `BottomNavigation`, `SecondaryMenuDrawer`, `SceneLink`, `PageHeader`, `PageTabs`, `PageTabBar`, `PageContainer`), `lib/constants/navigation.ts` (the ONE source of the nav arrays), `lib/utils/viewTransition.ts` (the ONE `startViewTransition`), `lib/hooks/useSceneNavigation.ts` (the page scene), `components/ui/sidebar.tsx` (`SIDEBAR_WIDTH_ICON`, the icon rail), `lib/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts`, or adding a route to the nav, a tab bar to a page or a `view-transition-name` to anything. `AGENTS.md` keeps the stub in § Navigation (and the rest of § Motion); here is the full rule, the two page-scene bullets of § Motion included. Files: § *Files* below. Exercised by `e2e/shell.boot.spec.ts` (1440) and `e2e/shell.boot.mobile.spec.ts` (390), whose shared assertions live in `e2e/shellBoot.ts`.

## Files

Compiled on 2026-09-30, when § Navigation and two § Motion bullets moved here from `AGENTS.md`: only the files the
rules below name.

- **Layout and scene**: `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` (`<main>` = `page-main`), `app/dashboard/template.tsx`,
  `lib/hooks/useSceneNavigation.ts`, `lib/utils/viewTransition.ts`, `lib/utils/themeTransition.ts`, the `::view-transition-*` rules in `app/globals.css`, `next.config.ts`
- **Navigation**: `lib/constants/navigation.ts` (`assistantNavItem`), `components/layout/SceneLink.tsx`,
  `components/layout/{Sidebar,BottomNavigation,SecondaryMenuDrawer}.tsx` (`AppSidebar`, `NavItems`, `AddExpenseFab`),
  `components/ui/sidebar.tsx` (`SIDEBAR_WIDTH_ICON`, `sidebarMenuButtonVariants`)
- **Page frame**: `components/layout/{PageHeader,PageTabs,PageTabBar,PageContainer}.tsx` (`PageHeaderSkeleton`,
  `pageTabPanelId`), `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, `lib/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts`,
  `components/ui/{tile,tile-grid-skeleton,skeleton,page-verdict}.tsx` (`TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS`); the «Crea snapshot»
  action in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Specs**: `e2e/shell.boot.spec.ts`, `e2e/shell.boot.mobile.spec.ts`, their helper `e2e/shellBoot.ts`;
  `e2e/cashflow.split.spec.ts` (a `PageTabs` panel's name)

## Navigation
- **The shell renders BEFORE Firebase Auth resolves** (2026-09-28): `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` keeps the
  skip link, `AppSidebar`, `<main>` and `BottomNavigation` OUTSIDE `ProtectedRoute`, which wraps only `{children}`
  inside `<main>` with the compact header's silhouette (`PageHeaderSkeleton`, no `h1`) and the generic
  `TileGridSkeleton` (labelled «Verifica dell'accesso») as its `fallback`, kept on screen through the redirect to
  `/login`; `main h1` therefore still means «the page has mounted». So every shell component runs on the server and
  hydrates: nothing in it reads `window`/`document` during render, `AppSidebar` and `SecondaryMenuDrawer` accept
  `user` null (the profile is two `Skeleton` lines on a 44px button, no layout shift when the name lands), the demo
  banner appears WITH the user, and `AuthContext` sets `user` and `loading` in the same commit with nothing awaited in
  front (the Firestore `displayName` fallback lands afterwards, doc/guide/accesso-registrazione.md).
  `npm run perf:budget`'s «testo» column reads that HTML: a dashboard route back at 0 has put the shell behind the
  gate again.
- **`useMediaQuery` is SSR-safe — `false` on the server and during hydration, the real value right after**
  (`useSyncExternalStore`, 2026-09-28). The shell's FIRST frame is therefore decided by CSS — the fixed sidebar is
  `hidden desktop:block`, the bottom nav `desktop:hidden`, the mobile Sheet mounts only when opened — never by that
  value; a component mounted AFTER login is not hydrating and still reads the real value on its first render.
  `e2e/shell.boot.spec.ts` and `shell.boot.mobile.spec.ts` assert the console carries no hydration message at 1440
  and 390, and that a stored theme is on `<html>` at the first frame (the `<head>` script, doc/guide/temi.md).
- **A `PageTabs` panel names ITSELF** (2026-09-21): `PageTabBar` renders plain buttons, not Radix
  `TabsTrigger`s, so every `TabsContent` was born with an `aria-labelledby` naming a trigger id that
  does not exist and had an EMPTY accessible name. A panel takes `id={pageTabPanelId(layoutId,
  value)}`, an `aria-label`, and `aria-labelledby={undefined}` to drop Radix's own; the tabs take
  `aria-controls` through `renderedPanels`, which a page with lazily mounted panels must pass — an
  `aria-controls` naming a panel that was never opened is the same dangling reference from the other
  end. Pinned by `e2e/cashflow.split.spec.ts`.
- **An inactive `PageTabs` panel keeps its `div`, not its CONTENT** (2026-09-22): Radix renders the panel (so its id
  and `aria-controls` survive) but unmounts the children, so a field of another tab is not in the DOM and a spec
  anchors on the OPENED panel (`#<layoutId>-panel-<tab> section`), never on a tile of a tab that is not showing.
- **Single source for nav arrays**: `lib/constants/navigation.ts` — Sidebar, BottomNavigation and SecondaryMenuDrawer all
  import from it, never redeclare inline. **A route link in the shell is a `SceneLink`** (`components/layout/SceneLink.tsx`,
  a `next/link` whose plain left click runs the page scene — prefetch, modifier clicks, `target` and the caller's own
  `onClick` are untouched); a bare `<Link>` there navigates without the scene. **The assistant is `assistantNavItem`**,
  a route rendered by the same `NavItems` as the groups (gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_AI_ENABLED` at render); there
  is no banner component to restyle.
- **The shell's label is the tiles' eyebrow**: sidebar group labels, the drawer's section labels and the compact
  `PageHeader` all use `TILE_EYEBROW_CLASS` (`components/ui/tile.tsx`) — on the sidebar surface with
  `text-sidebar-foreground/60`, because `text-muted-foreground` is tuned against `--background`, not `--sidebar`.
  Do not reintroduce a 12px label in the chrome (DESIGN.md → The One-Eyebrow Rule).
- **`PageHeader` has ONE variant, the compact one**: `variant="legacy"` was deleted on 2026-08-26 with Previdenza, the
  last page that declared it (DESIGN.md; the pre-redesign 30px title survives only in `git log`). The desktop title is
  `text-sm` and the phone navbar's `h1` 17px, so never put an icon sized for the old title inside it (FIRE's 32px flame
  was dropped, not shrunk). (Corrected on 2026-09-30: this bullet still described the default `compact` and the opt-out.)
- **Icon rail geometry lives in the primitive**: `SIDEBAR_WIDTH_ICON` (3.5rem) and the `group-data-[collapsible=icon]`
  size on `sidebarMenuButtonVariants` (`size-11!`, `p-3.5!`, `justify-center`) are what make every collapsed target
  44×44; `SidebarGroup`/`SidebarHeader`/`SidebarFooter` drop to `p-1.5` in icon mode for the same reason. A custom
  button in the rail (the collapse toggle) needs its own `group-data-[state=collapsed]:size-11`.
- **`PageHeader` mounts its `actions` — and its `h1` — TWICE** (desktop row, phone navbar): a `ref` on an action lands
  on whichever copy mounted last and `querySelector` finds the HIDDEN one first (width 0, 2026-09-18). Take the pressed
  node from `event.currentTarget` (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`, «Crea snapshot»); measure the copy with `offsetWidth > 0`;
  in a spec `main h1` is a strict-mode violation until it is `.filter({ visible: true })` (2026-09-28, `e2e/shellBoot.ts`).
- **`PageContainer`** is the 1920px root of a tile page (its only width since 2026-09-06); the loading state must use
  the same width or the page jumps when data lands (the Panoramica's skeleton was 1600 while the page was 1920). The
  loading state of a tile page is `TileGridSkeleton` with the page's own `cells` — never a per-page skeleton component.
- **A shell component that reads `useSearchParams` puts it in a child rendered inside `<Suspense>`** (`AddExpenseFab` in
  `BottomNavigation`): the layout is a `'use client'` component that is
  still prerendered — the shell is in the HTML since 2026-09-28 — and the hook bails static rendering out without a
  boundary. **A PAGE under `ProtectedRoute` needs no boundary** (verified 2026-10-08, Impostazioni and Cashflow read
  `useSearchParams` at their root and `/dashboard/settings` is in the prerender manifest): on the server `loading` is
  always true, so `ProtectedRoute` renders only its fallback and the page function never runs at prerender — the rule
  above is for what sits OUTSIDE it.
- **The bottom nav's layout animations run only where it is visible** (2026-10-08): it stays mounted at every
  width (it is in the prerendered shell), but `layout` on the `motion.nav` and the active pill's `layoutId` follow
  `useMediaQuery('(max-width: 1439px) and (orientation: portrait)')` — the complement of its `desktop:hidden
  max-desktop:landscape:hidden` classes, `PILL_VISIBLE_QUERY` beside them. The `motion.nav` carries a `key` on that
  value: a `layout` turned on after mount never animates (the query is `true` only after hydration), and the pill used
  to JUMP aside when the «+» appeared. Pinned by `e2e/motion.layout{,.mobile}.spec.ts` (0 measures at 1440, a glide at
  390). In dev the page scene freezes rendering while the route compiles, so the glide is asserted without view
  transitions.
- **Sidebar active state for `/dashboard` must be `pathname === item.href`**, never `startsWith`. **Bottom nav is
  portrait-only**, so an in-page button duplicating the FAB must be hidden **only in portrait** — in landscape the FAB
  is gone and it is the only add affordance.

## Motion — the page scene and view transitions
- **Page transitions use `template.tsx`, NOT `layout.tsx` + `AnimatePresence`** (it re-mounts on every navigation);
  remove page-level `motion.div variants` wrappers once it is in place (compounded opacity: t²). **Since 2026-09-12 a
  click on a shell link is a page SCENE** — a native view transition (`lib/hooks/useSceneNavigation.ts` →
  `runViewTransition('page', …)`, whose DOM update resolves when `usePathname()` changes, with a 700 ms guard for a route
  the dev server is still compiling) — and `template.tsx` stands down for that mount (`<html data-vt="page">` read once in
  a `useState` initializer): two fades on one page compound. React 19.2 stable exports no `ViewTransition` and
  `next.config` enables no experimental flag; the native API is the whole mechanism, and a browser without it (Firefox)
  or a reader with reduced motion gets a plain `router.push` and the template's fade.
- **`lib/utils/viewTransition.ts` is the ONE entry to `document.startViewTransition`**, and it stamps `data-vt="theme"` or
  `data-vt="page"` on `<html>` for the length of the transition: every `::view-transition-*` rule in `globals.css` is
  scoped by that attribute. An unscoped `::view-transition-new(root)` rule runs on EVERY transition — the theme's
  circle-clip used to be global and would have clipped every navigation. **A `view-transition-name` must be unique among
  the RENDERED elements of a page**, or the browser skips the whole transition (the update still applies, silently):
  `page-verdict` lives on `PageVerdict` and on the skeleton's verdict block (never both mounted), `page-header` on
  `PageHeader`, `page-main` on the layout's `<main>`, `bottom-nav` on the phone pill's fixed container; a `forceMount`
  tab panel is `display: none` and does not count. Do not name the tile grid — several pages render more than one.
- **A named element leaves `root` for EVERY view transition, not only its own scene** (2026-10-08, found on the
  owner's tour; both defects dated from 2026-09-12). Two consequences, both pinned by `e2e/motion.layout{,.mobile}.spec.ts`
  and seen red: (1) the theme's circle is drawn on `::view-transition-new(root)`, so with the page scene's names on
  it revealed only the sidebar while the page cross-faded — `html[data-vt="theme"] *` switches every name off for the
  theme scene (`globals.css`; `data-vt` is stamped before `startViewTransition`); (2) a named region paints in a layer
  ABOVE `root`, so on a phone `page-main` covered the fixed bottom pill for the whole page scene (it faded under the
  figures and popped back at the end) — the pill's container has its own name, later in paint order than `<main>`,
  with no animation in the page scene. A new fixed piece of shell over `<main>` needs the same.

## Per-page blind spots

- **The icon rail's 44px targets are measured at 1440 with a mouse**; no fixture covers a ≥1440px tablet in landscape.
