# Stati: caricamento, vuoto, zero, errore

> **When to open this guide** — anyone touching `lib/utils/statesNarrative.ts` (`AbsenceKind`, `resolveSurfaceState`, `describeReadFailure`, `describeLastSuccessfulRead`), `components/ui/{skeleton,empty-state,error-notice,tile-grid-skeleton}.tsx`, `components/ui/sonner.tsx` (the severity of a toast), or wiring a loading · empty · zero · failed branch on any surface. `AGENTS.md` keeps the stub with the essentials; here is the full rule. File: § *Files* below.

## Files

- **Stati**: `lib/utils/statesNarrative.ts` (`resolveSurfaceState` = the one wait/failure decision), `components/ui/{skeleton,empty-state,error-notice}.tsx`, `components/ui/sonner.tsx` — doc/guide/stati.md

## Stati: caricamento, vuoto, zero, errore

- **An absence has three names, and they are not interchangeable** (DESIGN.md → The Absence-Has-Three-Names Rule):
  `missing` (nothing recorded) · `zero` (something is, and it is zero) · `failed` (the read did not happen). The
  `AbsenceKind` union in `statesNarrative.ts` exists so a component cannot collapse them into a boolean.
- **`resolveSurfaceState({ loading, failed })` is the ONE decision on which of the four states a surface is in**, and
  `loading` wins over `failed` because React Query re-enters `isLoading` while it retries — a retry is an attempt, not
  a verdict. What it exists to stop is `loading || !data`, the collapse that made the Panoramica pulse **forever** on a
  failed read (fixed 2026-09-01); the E2E probe that catches it asserts the skeleton's `role="status"` is GONE once the
  alert is up.
- **A failed read is checked BEFORE the empty branch, always.** Every query in this app defaults to `[]` or
  `undefined`, so a dropped connection is byte-identical to a new account — and the empty branch would then print a
  verdict about a set that was never read («non hai nessun centro di costo», to someone with eight).
- **`describeReadFailure` requires its `consequence`.** There is no generic fallback on purpose: a shared module does
  not know the Italian agreement of a subject it was handed («Classi non è stato letto» is wrong), and a sentence that
  claims nothing is worse than no sentence. The caller knows what it lost. `untouched` is optional and defaults to
  «Nessun dato registrato è stato toccato»; `canRetry` and `onRetry` travel together, so no button is ever offered
  that does nothing.
- **The reassurance is said once per page**: `compact` drops it inside a cell of 4 columns or fewer, because three
  lines in a 3/12 cell make the notice taller than the tiles beside it. On a page where several queries fail together
  at least one of them is wide, so the sentence survives.
- **A service must not swallow its own failure into zeros.** `getAnnualCashflowData` did (a `catch` returning
  `annualSavings: 0`), which meant the FIRE calculator answered a dropped connection with «servono spese registrate
  nel Cashflow» — a sentence about the reader's data, told about data nobody read. It rejects now; both its callers
  hold an `ErrorNotice` branch that only a rejection can reach. When wiring a new surface, check the service too: an
  `isError` branch above a service that never rejects is decoration.
- **`Skeleton` (`components/ui/skeleton.tsx`) is the only muted placeholder.** `motion-safe:animate-pulse` — Tailwind's
  bare `animate-pulse` has no reduced-motion guard, and it was hand-written in eight files at six different heights —
  and `aria-hidden`, so the wait is announced once by `TileGridSkeleton`'s `role="status"`. `animate-spin` is
  deliberately left alone: a spinner IS the "in flight" signal, and at 16px it is not the vestibular problem the
  preference is about.
- **Reduced motion reduces the MOTION, not the content.** `shouldShowSavingsBadge` used to take `reducedMotion` as a
  show condition, so a reader who had asked the OS for stillness was never told their savings rate. It now governs the
  entrance transition only, in the component. No surface fires confetti any more (Storico's burst went on 2026-09-13, the
  FIRE Calcolatore's on 2026-09-22 with its critique), so `celebrationUtils` keeps only the once-per-milestone record.
- **A toast's severity is the icon and a 2px leading rule, never the surface.** Sonner maps `--normal-bg` for every
  type, so before this an error and a success were the same grey tile with a different 16px glyph. The tint variant was
  rejected: `bg-*/10` washes the fill with the text's own hue and this project already records those combinations as
  structurally below AA.
- **A failed WRITE speaks `describeWriteError`, on a toast exactly as in a modal.** Thirteen call sites passed
  `(err as Error).message` straight through — the thing that module exists to prevent. Where the message really is the
  product's own Italian (the assistant hooks' `payload?.error ?? '<italiano>'`), the throw is marked with
  `userFacingError` so the translation keeps it; everything unmarked takes the generic sentence. The assistant's SSE
  route no longer forwards the Anthropic SDK's English message to the client either — that string is a log line.
- **Where the 20 surfaces are**: `app/dashboard/{page,assets,history,performance,allocation,hall-of-fame,settings}`,
  the five Cashflow tabs (the `loadFailed` prop is threaded from `app/dashboard/{cashflow,analisi}/page.tsx`, because
  the tabs do not own their queries), Dividendi, the five FIRE tabs, Previdenza and Centri di Costo. Adding a
  twenty-first means: read the query's `isError`, branch with `resolveSurfaceState`, and write the `consequence`.

## Per-page blind spots

- **Il ramo `isError` copre 20 superfici, non ogni query**: cablate quelle da cui dipende il verdetto o l'inventario, non le secondarie (prezzi, benchmark, FX) — una di quelle che fallisce degrada ancora in silenzio. (moved from `CLAUDE.md` → Known Issues on 2026-09-19)
