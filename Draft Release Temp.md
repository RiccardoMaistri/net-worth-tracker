## ✨ New Features

- Added «Aggiungi una nota» to every ranked row of the Hall of Fame: the form opens with the row's period and ranking already written (on hover with a mouse, always in the «Nota» column of the full table), and it says when the period sits in none of the rankings you ticked.
- Added the recovery to the Record del patrimonio footer of the Hall of Fame («da allora 32 mesi su 35 in crescita»), so the tile that celebrates no longer ends on its one red figure; it appears after the next recalculation.
- Added the date of the last recalculation to the Hall of Fame header («record aggiornati il 24/09/2026»), so an account the nightly cron cannot refresh no longer looks up to date.
- Added the year under the first bar of each year on the twelve record months chart, which could not say WHEN with «mar … mar, set … set» alone.
- Added «2 mesi» beside a first year the rankings measure on a handful of months, as «finora» already marks the running year.

- Added «Distribuzione» to the FIRE Calcolatore's Traguardo: the year each of the thousand simulated paths reaches FIRE, as a histogram by calendar year («Metà dei percorsi è FIRE entro il 2034, come nel base»).
- Added the lever on the bad tail under that histogram: how much more saving per year brings nine paths in ten within the base year («servirebbero 6000 € l'anno di risparmio in più»).
- Added «dal FIRE in poi» to the same view: from its own FIRE year each path withdraws the expenses, and the sentence says how many still hold capital at 90.
- Added the state pension and the tax on withdrawals to the FIRE number, as two rows of the Base di calcolo that every figure of the tab runs on («13.000 € · netti l'anno, dal 2060»), what is missing said in the row.
- Added the same two ingredients to the Monte Carlo plan, with two read-only rows under it; What If and Coast FIRE read the same tax, so the five tabs agree on what retirement costs.
- Added «Esaurimento» to the Monte Carlo's Distribuzione: the simulations that fail, by the year their capital runs out, instead of a 0 € in the first bin of the final values.
- Added the «quando» to Coast FIRE's «Non ancora» («Al ritmo attuale, 12.000 € l'anno di risparmio, lo raggiungi nel 2031, a 40 anni»), drawn on the chart as a dotted line.
- Added the three tiles to Coast FIRE's empty state, each saying why it cannot answer, with one way out («Aggiungi il primo asset» or the missing field).
- Added the four tiles to the FIRE Calcolatore's empty state, each saying why it cannot answer, with one way out («Registra le spese nel Cashflow» or «Aggiungi il primo asset»).
- Added «già raggiunto» to the FIRE Calcolatore's Scenari tile, Ventaglio footer and chart for a target already cleared today.

- Added the instruments to Ribilancia on Allocazione: the plan no longer stops at «vendi 5000 € di azioni», it names the sub-sleeves and the ETFs you would actually trade, exactly as Versa and Preleva already did, and every leg adds back up to its class. The mode the page opens on is now one you can carry to a broker.
- Added the meaning everyone reads into «Preleva» on Allocazione: asking for 1000 € now means 1000 € in hand, so the plan sells what survives the tax — «Per prelevare 1000 € netti vendi 1087 €… la ritenuta stimata è 87 €» — instead of selling 1000 € and telling you afterwards that 913 € arrived. When the gross would not fit what you can trade, it says the figure will fall short rather than promising it.
- Added the withholding to Ribilancia too, which sells without being asked for an amount: its reading closes on what reaches you («incassi 3700 € netti, dopo circa 1300 € di ritenuta»), estimated on the capital gain of the slice being sold, and the footer now explains the method instead of admitting the tax was ignored. Where an instrument has no cost basis or no rate the figure is dropped rather than guessed.

- Added «Vai al contenuto principale» as the first Tab stop of every dashboard page, and a heading to every tile, so a screen reader can walk a page tile by tile.

- Added «Collega spese…» to a cost center: search your expenses, filter them by category and year, tick the ones that belong and link them in one confirm («3 rate · 2 in calendario» for a series), with «Annulla» on the outcome that puts every expense back.
- Added two actions to each row of a center's «Movimenti collegati»: its category opens the expense in its form, and «Scollega» takes it out of the center in place; a row of a series asks «solo questa o tutta la serie?».
- Added an address to every open cost center: a reload keeps it, Back returns to the list, the link can be sent to a co-owner, and on a phone the detail opens at its top.
- Added «in uso da …» to a cost center's colour picker: a colour another active center wears is marked and named, and a new center opens on the first free colour.
- Added the way in to Centri di Costo where a first visit needs it: the empty page, an empty center and the «Nuovo centro» window say that an expense is linked from its own form («Centro di Costo», under «Impostazioni avanzate»).
- Added the record month to the Totale tile of Centri di Costo («Settembre, ancora in corso, è già il mese più caro degli ultimi 12»), with this year's share of the whole cost.

- Added «in calendario» to the Spese maggiori rows of Analisi that are dated ahead (a long caption such as «30 set · Palestra · in calendario» now wraps to a second line instead of being cut), and the Flusso tile says in words what a click does («un tipo di spesa apre il suo dettaglio; una categoria o una sottocategoria apre la scheda»), which used to live in a hover tooltip only.
- Added a cut to the Flusso's subcategory view, named in its aside: only the six largest categories open into their four largest subcategories plus one «Altre N» node that still adds up; every other category stays in the chart as a leaf (the old view dropped a category without subcategories entirely).

- Added a second sentence to the Cashflow verdict whenever the calendar reaches past today: the judgement is on what has happened, then where the calendar takes the month («Con 1000 € di spese e 2000 € di entrate già in calendario da qui a fine mese, il mese chiude a +700 € (il 30%)») — mid-month the page used to say «Settembre sta andando bene» on a salary still to come.
- Added the «solo questa o tutte?» modal for deleting a row of an instalment plan or a recurring series, naming the row, the plan and what the account gets back; a plain row arms in place and says what the second press does («Eliminando, il conto viene riaccreditato di 100,00 €»).
- Added «Riduce il debito di» to a Debito entry: on the instalment's own date the property's residual debt falls by the principal only, the instalment minus the month's interest at the property's TAN («sul debito di oggi 400 € di 1000 €, il resto (600 €) sono interessi al TAN 3,6%»). The house's net value and Storico's «mutuo» follow the plan without a monthly edit, and deleting or editing an instalment gives back exactly what it had repaid.
- Added «Commissione» to a Trasferimento: the bank's charge becomes a spending entry of its own in the category chosen in Impostazioni › Spese («Commissioni sui trasferimenti»), debited from the origin account on the transfer's date. It is edited from the transfer and deleted with it; without a category the field stays off and links the setting.
- Added «Collega la serie a un conto» and «Collega la serie al mutuo» to the detail of an instalment or a recurring entry: the entries still to come take the account, each moving it on its own date, or the property whose mortgage they repay, and a movement's detail names both («Conto corrente · si muove il 28 settembre», «Casa · capitale 400,00 €»).
- Added memory to the «Feed | Tabella» switch of Movimenti: the table stays the table across visits.
- Added a count to the Movimenti filters on a phone or a tablet («2 filtri attivi: restano 27 movimenti su 112.», «Mostra 27 movimenti»), with «Ripristina» beside it.

- Added «in calendario» as its own figure on Cashflow › Budget: the verdict names what is spent and what is still dated after today («hai speso 600 € e hai altri 1000 € già in calendario (1600 € su 3000 €, il 53% del tetto)»), the hero prints the spent amount with «+ 1000 € in calendario» beside it, and the bar carries two fills — spent, then scheduled in a lighter shade.
- Added the calendar to every Avvisi row: «soglia 50% · anno al 70%» under a crossed threshold, painted amber only when the share is ahead of its own window, «da gennaio» on an annual budget already over, and «soglie di quota» in the aside.
- Added «Conferma» in words to every budget row's delete, the consequence printed in the row («Eliminando, il budget di Cibo sparisce; le spese restano.») and an announcement for screen readers; the pencil steps aside while the row is armed.

- Added the calendar to every figure on Cashflow › Divisione: a person's tile now prints what is left of their salary today and says underneath where the month takes it («Con le spese ancora in calendario mancano 100 €»), and the verdict closes the same way. A bill due at the end of the month no longer counts as money already gone — before this, someone could be told their salary had run out over a bill still sitting in their account.
- Added the missing declaration to the shares on Divisione: a salary left «in comune», or one belonging to somebody no longer in Famiglia, is now named out loud («Altri 1000 € di reddito da lavoro non sono intestati a nessuno e non entrano nelle quote») instead of leaving the percentages to be computed on part of the month without saying so.
- Added «Attribuisci spese» to Divisione, the one thing the tab could not do from itself: it opens Tracciamento with the «Intestatario» filter already on «In comune», so the rows the page counts are one click from the form that decides who they belong to.

- Added the held portfolio as the subject of Affidabilità and Chi paga di più on Cashflow › Dividendi: the rows rank only the instruments still held, what a sold one paid is named in its own clause («altri 100 € da 2 strumenti venduti»), a residual row and the footer («restano fuori: non sono reddito su cui contare»); the verdict and the inventory keep reading the whole registry.
- Added «Attesa» in words to an announced payment on a phone — the chip in the row, «Incassate / Annunciate» totals under the list, «attesa» and a warning hairline on the calendar's day — where the colour of the number was the only difference.
- Added the instrument's own tax rate to the dividend form's withholding proposal (12,5% on a BTP), «Cedola» as the default type of a bond's payment, and every equity or bond — held or sold — to its picker; the form refuses in its reading line in Italian and marks the first missing field.
- Added arrow-key navigation to the payments calendar and one tab stop for the period axis (a radiogroup the arrows move); the instrument's name in the payments table is a button that opens the record from the keyboard.
- Added a single «Pagamenti» tile with the two next actions when no dividend is recorded, instead of a 0 € hero beside «Copertura 0%» and «Chi paga di più 0 €».
- Added a credit account for dividends and coupons: each instrument can name the account its payments land on (the asset form, «Conto di accredito dividendi» — two brokers, two accounts) and Impostazioni › Dividendi holds the default for the others. A payment dated today or later credits that account when its income is recorded; payments already in the past are recorded without moving any balance, so a first download of the history never counts them twice.

- Added negative balances to cash accounts, so a credit card can be tracked as an account in the red until the bank pays it off: the Liquidità tile reads it as «debito» and measures the other accounts' shares on the money actually held, and the Panoramica counts it in the cash part of your liquidity instead of the invested part.
- Added «TAN del mutuo» to a property with a residual debt, which splits each linked instalment into interest and principal; without it the whole instalment lowers the debt, and the form says so.
- Added «Mutuo» to Patrimonio for a property whose instalments are linked to its debt: the interest and principal paid this year, the debt and when the plan ends («Nel 2026 hai pagato 400 € di interessi e rimborsato 5000 € di capitale, in 10 rate; al ritmo di oggi il mutuo si chiude a novembre 2036»), and from the second year a table year by year. It counts from the first instalment linked, never before.
- Added the maturity and the next coupon under a bond’s name in the Strumenti table («scade il 10/03/2032 · prossima cedola 10/12»), on desktop and on a phone: a BTP no longer reads like a crypto row.
- Added «Andamento» as a view of the Strumenti table: the three Δ windows take the place of Quantità, Prezzo, PMC and TER, are sortable, and the table no longer scrolls sideways at 1440; both toggles are remembered.
- Added «Tasse trattenute» to the sale form of the Registro operazioni: prefilled with the estimate — the price difference at the instrument's rate, with no commission, as the broker computes it — and following it until you type the figure on your statement. The settlement account now receives proceeds less fees less that tax («Accredito sul conto», printed before you save) instead of the gross, which had to be corrected by hand and read as «altre variazioni» in the verdicts.

- Added deep links from the Panoramica: a row of «Spese per categoria» or «Entrate per categoria» opens that category's Scheda on Analisi, the two tiles read the concentration («Il 29% va in Mutuo; le prime tre fanno il 63%») and close on «Tutte le categorie in Analisi», Composizione on «Il piano in Allocazione».
- Added what was bought beside a sale to the verdicts of the Panoramica, Patrimonio and the periodic email («Nello stesso mese hai comprato 3 strumenti per 10.000 €»), so a reinvested sale no longer reads as money gone.

- Added a way to read a single month on the Rendimenti heatmap without a mouse: tap a cell, or reach the grid with Tab and move with the arrows, and the month's return is printed on a line under the grid («Aprile 2026 · +6,6%»). Cells are 44px tall on a phone.
- Added «Come si calcola» to every Rendimenti tile: the footers are one line, and the method opens on request.

- Added a ledger to Storico's «Driver della crescita»: behind each year the parts of the growth are rows that add up, to the euro, to the growth they close on («Risparmio +5000 € · Mercato +8000 € · Tasse sulle vendite −1000 € · … · Crescita del patrimonio +12.000 €»), and «Dal 2025» sums every year as one more row. The sentence above names the two engines, the heavier first, and nets the rest into one figure («Il resto, voce per voce qui sotto, vale +1000 €»).
- Added sorting to Storico's «Valore per strumento» — by value, by the change on the previous month, by its price part or its quantity part — and a selection panel that stays in sight while you tick further down the list.
- Added «Come si calcola» to the tiles of Storico: each footer is one line, and the method opens on request.

- Added «Aggiorna valore» to Previdenza: the monthly overwrite of a pension fund's value from its statement now lives on the page — in the header beside «Registra versamento» and in the footer of «Il fondo oggi» — instead of in the asset form. The dialog states the trap before the field: «I 500 € versati questo mese sono già dentro l'estratto: non aggiungerli».

- Added a save bar to Impostazioni: while any tab holds changes, a bar at the bottom of the page names them («Modifiche non salvate in Allocazione e Preferenze») with «Annulla modifiche» beside «Salva», and each tab with pending edits carries a dot. Reloading or closing the page with edits pending asks first; the old «Anteprima attiva» chip did not exist on a phone and never said which tab held the change.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed the running year cut to «20…» in the Anni tile of the Hall of Fame at every width.
- Fixed «il 88,5%», «Gli 10 anni» and «dal migliore» over a ranking of costs on the Hall of Fame («l'88,5%», «i 10 anni», «dal più alto»).
- Fixed the Hall of Fame printing the record month's figures three times in 200 px: the Anni tile now says the distance from the place above («è a 8610 € dal secondo posto»).
- Fixed the two note windows of the Hall of Fame dropping the keyboard focus on the page body when closed.
- Fixed «Salva ipotesi» on Coast FIRE for a shared account, which saved a co-owner's changes to their own unused document while reporting success.
- Fixed the Coast FIRE chart naming colours the theme does not paint, with a legend at 3,1:1 and cents on its tooltip.
- Fixed the captions of the Coast FIRE rows and the «Parte a 61 anni» chips measuring 2,6:1 in light mode.
- Fixed the first frame of Coast FIRE and of the FIRE Calcolatore counting the hero up from «0 €» beside a track already filled.
- Fixed the FIRE Calcolatore contradicting itself once you are FIRE («Sei già FIRE.» over «2027 · tra 1 anno»): «già raggiunto» now replaces «tra 1 anno».
- Fixed the Scenari chart's description for screen readers naming colours the theme does not paint.
- Fixed three legends on the FIRE Calcolatore printed in the series' own colour at 3,1:1 and 3,8:1.
- Fixed the captions of the FIRE tiles («124 € al mese») measuring 2,6:1 in light mode.
- Fixed «FIRE Orso», «FIRE Base» and «FIRE Toro» stacking on the Scenari chart when two scenarios reach the target in the same year («FIRE Base · Toro»).
- Fixed «Anni di spesa coperti» wrapping under its own figure on the Reddito passivo tile.
- Fixed the FIRE Ventaglio under the pension lock aiming its paths at the number without the lock while the verdict named the bridge one.

- Fixed COMPRA, VENDI and OK being unreadable in light mode on Allocazione: the guard meant to correct the chart colours for text had never run, and the chip labels, the plan's amounts and the gap column now clear the contrast floor in every one of the twelve colour themes, light and dark.
- Fixed «Allineato al 85%», which is not Italian: the verdict now writes «all'85%», and so for every score whose name starts with a vowel.
- Fixed Allocazione calling a class «in linea» when it holds nothing and targets nothing: such a class now says where its money is («esclusa dall'allocazione · 60.000 €»), closes the list, and no longer inflates the «N classi su M» count.
- Fixed the same column of Per classe carrying two different bases without saying so: a sub-category's «corrente» is a share of its class, and opening a class now declares it.
- Fixed the Esposizione reading ignoring the list it sits above: on «Settori» and «Emittenti» it now opens on the view you are in, and its aside names the base of the percentage column.
- Fixed a screen reader hearing no figures in Per classe: the row's accessible name replaced its own contents, so a keyboard reader heard eight class names and not one percentage; the tile now reads as the data table it is.
- Fixed «Modifica target» being two Tab stops for one action, and invalid markup, at both widths.

- Fixed the month-end and year-end figures of a cost center, which extrapolated a daily pace: one large repair mid-month was projected to almost twice its amount by month end, and a recurring charge already in the calendar was counted twice. A center now reads what is spent and what the calendar still adds («con il calendario chiude a 1000 €»); Budget keeps its pace.
- Fixed a cost center's ceiling called «a rischio» on a pace alone: the risk is now the expenses already dated ahead carrying it past («supererà il tetto del 2026», «Lo superi il 28 con le spese già in calendario»), and a ceiling crossed by what is spent is the fact. The list and the detail no longer disagree about an idle center with an instalment to come.
- Fixed two cost centers sharing one colour by construction: every new center was created on the first colour, so two cars were one blue in the list, the legend and two adjacent bands of the bars. Centers already saved keep their colour until edited.
- Fixed the cost-center dot in the expense form, which was painted with an invalid colour and never showed; archived centers no longer appear there, except on the expense already linked to one.
- Fixed «Anno scorso · 2025, intero» on a cost-center history that began in September 2025: it now reads «2025, da settembre», so four months are not compared with a whole year.
- Fixed the focus falling to the top of the document when a cost center was opened, closed or its window dismissed, and the subcategory rows announcing «premuto» on the ones taken out of the total.

- Fixed the Scheda of Analisi printing three paces for one category on the running year: the pace now divides the lived total by the months lived («Media mensile · sui primi 9 mesi»), the projection takes the calendar as a floor and disappears when it would only restate the total, and the reading names the delta's own window («nei primi 9 mesi 5000 €, in linea con gli stessi mesi del 2025»).
- Fixed Analisi's «Storico» running to 2043 on a materialised instalment plan: the history now closes on the current year, calendar included («Dal 2025 al 2026»).
- Fixed the verdict of the month in progress on Analisi comparing fourteen days against a whole month a year earlier: it now compares the same days on both sides («su settembre 2025 (primi 14 giorni)»), Confronto included, and says «Nessun movimento nei primi 14 giorni di settembre 2025: nessun confronto.» when there is nothing to compare.
- Fixed the Periodo reading on «Anno corrente» printing «Entrate in calo del 32,3% su 2025» in red with three salaries still to come: it now says «su 2025 (3 mesi ancora in calendario)» where the figure is printed.
- Fixed «Fuori scala» measuring a month that has not started, and a bookmarked year below the history floor drawing empty bars: the tile is absent for a month not started, and the year settles to the newest past one.
- Fixed the Flusso on an account with many categories: the plot's height follows its widest column, the nodes align from the sources, the labels are one neutral per mode, and the chart carries the tile's reading as its accessible name.
- Fixed the keyboard on Analisi: closing the Scheda returns the focus to what opened it, the search modal to its trigger, the period axis is a radiogroup, and the month names still in the calendar no longer sit under AA.

- Fixed the linked account of a recurring entry or an instalment plan, which moved once (the day it was saved) and never again — a mortgage entered in January left the account eleven instalments too high by December: every entry now moves the account on its own date, and deleting or editing one gives back only what it had moved.
- Fixed the Cashflow delta of the month in progress comparing fourteen days against the whole previous month («in calo del 59,8% su agosto»): it now compares the same days («sui primi 14 giorni di agosto»).
- Fixed the type colours of the Movimenti table painting income blue and fixed expenses green while the legend said the opposite: dot, badge and legend now share one colour per type, and an income amount takes the gain colour.
- Fixed «89% · 9% · 2%» painted outside the «Entrate per categoria» tile at 1440: the share column yields when the list is narrower than 250px.
- Fixed the expense form refusing an empty submit with «Invalid input» in English: every message is Italian, the reading says «Mancano 2 campi: Importo e Categoria.», and the first field scrolls into view and takes the focus.
- Fixed the transfer form: origin and destination accounts are required and must differ, with the reason under each field; a transfer could be saved without accounts and moved no money.
- Fixed the Movimenti table for a screen reader and for the eye: every header names its column and the sorted one its direction, dates and amounts are in the mono face, and «Tutte le categorie in Analisi» is a proper target.
- Fixed the tense of a future period («Nel 2043 hai speso») — a year of instalments is not gone yet.
- Fixed deleting a row of a recurring series or an instalment plan from its detail on the feed, which asked twice: «solo questa o tutta la serie?» is the confirmation, the first sheet is gone.

- Fixed the Budget verdict and hero calling «usato/speso» what was still in the calendar: with an instalment due late in the month the page said «hai usato il 53% del tetto … avanti rispetto al calendario» mid-month, on a fraction actually spent; the reading now compares only the spent share («il 20% del tetto al 47% del mese: 27 punti indietro … con le spese in calendario sei al 53%»).
- Fixed the Budget thresholds counting rows dated after today and ignoring the calendar: «Budget complessivo 65% · soglia 50%» in amber for a ceiling at 22%, and «Tecnologia 54% · soglia 50%» in amber with the year at 70%; a threshold is now a fact of what is spent, and a row behind its calendar is a number, not a warning.
- Fixed the budget form refusing in silence: the submit was disabled until the form was valid and the two refusals were red paragraphs under the amount; the reading line now says «Mancano 2 campi: Categoria e Importo.» or «L'importo supera i 2000 € disponibili sotto il tetto.», the field is marked and focused, the four radios are one tab stop, and the focus returns to «Aggiungi budget» on close.
- Fixed the Budget touch targets under 44px on a phone (the threshold chips, the ceiling input, the switch's row, the drawer's radios, select and amount, the empty state's button) and the progress bars announcing an exceeded budget as «100» to a screen reader (now «150%, oltre di 500 €»).
- Fixed «Salvato» staying in the Per categoria aside forever, the «fissa» rule repeated in three footers (now once, with its cause: the category's type), and the small animations of the tab that ignored the reduced-motion setting.

- Fixed the layout of Cashflow › Divisione above 1440px: the two people the page exists to compare sat on different rows, at different heights, with a large empty rectangle beside the lower one. They now stand side by side, same size, and the empty corner is gone.
- Fixed the repeated sentence on Divisione: when a salary is missing, the page verdict explains why the shares are absent and the «Quota» tile now says what to do about it («Registra lo stipendio di … in Tracciamento e intestaglielo») instead of reprinting the same words a few centimetres below.
- Fixed the month with nothing in it on Divisione: the page said the shares could not be calculated and, underneath, that there was nothing to divide — two explanations of one empty screen. It now says only the second, and stops printing a 0 € where nothing was measured at all.

- Fixed editing a dividend of a sold instrument, which opened the form with the Asset field blank and refused the save with «Asset non trovato»; and registering a BTP coupon by hand, which the picker did not allow at all.
- Fixed the 26% withholding the dividend form typed on every coupon (1,69 € proposed on a 6,50 € BTP coupon instead of 0,81 €).
- Fixed the verdict's «rendono l'1,3% lordo sul costo», a figure measured on one held instrument over twelve months and printed after «da 3 strumenti» identically in all four periods: it now names the window and the instruments it covers; «rendi l'1,3%, contro l'1,3%» reads «in linea con il valore di mercato».
- Fixed «Hai incassato in tutti i 1 mesi del periodo» under «Mese», and «10 mar · 70 €» for a premium due in March 2032 («10 mar 2032»).
- Fixed the focus landing nowhere after closing any of the four Dividendi modals: it goes back to the control that opened them.
- Fixed the armed delete of a dividend row, whose accessible name stayed «Elimina» while the button read «Conferma», with no announcement and no consequence in the row; the 3 s auto-disarm is gone.
- Fixed the payments calendar keeping a month browsed under «Storico» after a switch to «Mese» (January under a September verdict), and the scrape running for minutes with no signal because its confirm closed on the click.
- Fixed «Scarica dividendi storici» for an instrument added to the app after its dividends: the download now says how many payments were left out because they precede the day you hold the instrument, and how to include them (record the purchase in the Registro operazioni with its real date). It used to say only «Nessun nuovo dividendo trovato».
- Fixed an edited dividend never reaching its income in the Cashflow: the amount stayed the one first recorded. The income now follows the dividend, and so does the account it credited.

- Fixed the reading line of every modal, which was rendered smaller and greyer than designed and never turned red on a refused submit («Mancano 2 campi: …» was grey since the modals were unified): a refusal is now in the alert colour at the reading's size, on every form.
- Fixed the «Spese in comune» section of the periodic email, where the figure per person was printed in plain black whatever it said: somebody who came up short looked exactly like somebody who did not. It now carries the same green or red as the page, on what has actually been spent, and says underneath where the calendar takes it.
- Fixed the period selector on every page that uses it: on a phone it was 36 pixels tall and the month arrows inside it were 28, both under the size a thumb needs; they are now 44.
- Fixed the accessible name of every tabbed page — Cashflow, Impostazioni, FIRE e Simulazioni: a screen reader landing on a section heard nothing, because each panel was named after a control that does not exist in the page.
- Fixed the compact page header on phones, which was meant to stay at the top while the page scrolls and never did, on every page: «Salva» and the other header actions scrolled away with the content. It now stays, on an opaque background.
- Fixed the windows that open from a button drifting sideways as they opened and again as they closed — a note on Hall of Fame, a dividend's record, the custom period and the AI analysis on Rendimenti, a category's move or delete in Impostazioni. Each now grows from the button that opened it and shrinks back to it, in a straight line.

- Fixed the Registro’s XIRR on a young position: a position opened 47 days earlier printed «+4388,68% annualizzato»; under six months the vital is now «Rendimento sul periodo · +66,92% · in 53 giorni, non annualizzato».
- Fixed the asset form refusing a submit in English and in silence («Ticker is required»): the messages are Italian, the reading line says «Mancano 2 campi: Ticker e Nome.» and the first refused field scrolls into view.
- Fixed the cash-account detail: Escape while «Elimina» was armed closed the modal with the row still armed; the delete is now a two-click confirm without a timer and, while armed, the reading says what the second press loses and that it is not reversible.
- Fixed a property's residual debt that could not be removed: switching «Debito residuo» off in the asset form saved nothing, and the old debt came back on the next load.
- Fixed hand-valued rows in the Strumenti table (a property, a pension fund, a private-equity stake): they printed their whole value as a quantity at 1,0000 € and a «+0,00 €» gain that measured nothing; they now print «—» there, «valore a mano dal 12/08» under the name, and no G/P.
- Fixed the sale note of «Quanto costa vendere» in target mode, which re-read the gross value typed as a net proceed and added the tax on top.
- Fixed account balances moving by fractions of a cent on a trade or a dividend whose computed amount had more than two decimals: what reaches an account is rounded to the cent, as the bank does, while the record keeps its exact value.

- Fixed the odd animation of «Crea snapshot» on the Panoramica: the button no longer shrinks and slowly swells back under a click, and the confirmation no longer drifts diagonally as it opens — it grows from the button, in a straight line.
- Fixed the Panoramica's verdict naming the month's driver: it printed a database key («e pension hanno fatto il grosso del lavoro») and credited one class with more than the whole month, and now names the market's mover («sul mercato hanno spinto soprattutto i fondi pensione (+200 €)»), on Patrimonio too. The Cashflow tile says «Ad agosto» instead of «A agosto».
- Fixed the light-mode chart palette: Liquidità and Immobili were two oranges a reader could not tell apart, Trend Following and Obbligazioni two teals, and the net-worth curve was drawn in the colour of a loss; every class now keeps the same hue in light and dark (Azioni blue, Obbligazioni green, Criptovalute amber, Immobili violet, Liquidità coral), in the emails and the PDF too.
- Fixed the truncated category names in the ranked lists of the Panoramica, Tracciamento, Analisi, Dividendi, Hall of Fame and Previdenza («Stipendio Giu…», «Entrate da inv…»): the name now takes the room it needs and the bar beside it takes the rest.
- Fixed the imposta di bollo on a conto corrente in the Costi tile: a flat 34,20 € a year above 5000 €, not 0,2% of the balance (an account with 6000 € was charged 12 €, one with a million 2000 €); the Impostazioni line now names the fee.

- Fixed the chart colours of four colour themes, where two asset classes could be one colour: on Solar Dusk (light) Obbligazioni and Immobili were the identical grey, Elegant Luxury painted three classes in three reds, Retro Arcade and Midnight Bloom had Immobili and Liquidità too close to tell apart. Every theme now keeps its classes apart in light and dark on every page that colours by class, by cost center or by category, and Cyberpunk's light mode no longer falls back to a generic palette for three of its colours.

- Fixed the Contributi tile of Rendimenti counting the opening positions of the operations-ledger migration as purchases: an account read as «investito» several times what it had really bought. Opening positions move no money and are no longer counted.
- Fixed «Analizza con AI» on Rendimenti running to completion after the window was closed: closing it now cancels the analysis, on the page and on the server.
- Fixed the keyboard focus being lost when «Periodo personalizzato» or «Analizza con AI» is closed: it returns to the button that opened the window.
- Fixed the period selector of Rendimenti leaving the keyboard order while a custom range is active, and «1 anno» wrapping to two lines on a phone.
- Fixed the heatmap legend of Rendimenti, which said «−5% … 0 … +5%» over colours that change at 1% and 2,5%: it now prints the real thresholds.
- Fixed the footer of «Capitale e mercato», which named the Cashflow's savings even when the figure was the capital measured on the base.
- Fixed «oggi» in the drawdown detail of Rendimenti on a custom range that ends in the past.

- Fixed Storico's «Driver della crescita» blaming the market for the tax withheld on a sale and for instalments still in calendar: the market is now measured instrument by instrument, the savings stop at today, and the tax, the mortgage repaid, the pension contributions and the other changes are rows of their own in each year's ledger.
- Fixed Storico's «Valore per strumento» hiding «di cui prezzo» and «di cui quantità» past the edge of its table on a desktop with no hint that it scrolled: the table now has the whole tile until you tick an instrument, then folds Quantità and Quota under their neighbours.
- Fixed a sale reading as a loss on Storico: a change moved mostly by quantities (a sale, a purchase, a deposit) no longer takes the red or the green, while its price part keeps its colour; in «Lavoro e investimenti» the flows lost their green too.
- Fixed «Mercato» having two colours on Storico (blue in the Driver, another in «Lavoro e investimenti», where blue was the labour income) and that chart's legend naming its icons in English to a screen reader.
- Fixed the rows of «Lavoro e investimenti» adding up to a euro more than the growth they close on: the rounding now lands in «Altre variazioni», the remainder by definition.
- Fixed the «Previdenza» band of Storico's Composizione wearing one fixed indigo on every theme, nearly the colour of Azioni on two of them: it now has its own colour per theme.
- Fixed «Elimina nota» on Storico deleting on a single press with no way back: the first press arms it, the second deletes, Esc lets go, and a note that fails to save says why.
- Fixed the keyboard path through Storico: the instruments of «Valore per strumento» are one Tab stop the arrows move through, and «Dettaglio» tells a screen reader what it opens.

- Fixed the fiscal year of a contribution: it is now chosen around the payment date (the year before, the year, the year after) instead of typed freely, so a typo can no longer file a contribution into a year the page never shows; a January payment for the previous year reads «Competenza 2025, pagato nel 2026».
- Fixed the delete confirmation in the Versamenti ledger: the row now says what the delete undoes («eliminando, il conto verrà riaccreditato») while the button stays a compact «Conferma».

- Fixed the delete of a saved conversation in the Assistente, which disarmed itself after three seconds: it now waits for you, says what goes («Eliminando, la conversazione e i suoi messaggi spariscono; la memoria resta.») and lets go on Esc without closing the window.

- Fixed Impostazioni answering a failed read with an empty list: when the shared accesses could not be loaded the tile said «Nessun accesso condiviso» — a reassurance about who can see your money, stated about data nobody read. That tile, the categories, the default accounts and the dividend settings now say the read failed, what that means, and offer «Riprova».
- Fixed the allocation targets of Impostazioni speaking English when a group of specific assets did not add up («Specific asset percentages must sum to exactly 100%»): every refusal of «Salva» is now an Italian sentence that names the group («Gli asset specifici di «ETF» (Azioni) sommano 80% invece del 100%»).
- Fixed a note under the allocation targets promising that changes reach Allocazione «immediatamente»: they arrive with «Salva», and the note now says so.

## 🔧 Improvements

- Improved the note form of the Hall of Fame: the rankings carry the tiles' own names («Crescita del patrimonio», «Entrate», «Risparmio») grouped under «Mensili» and «Annuali», each row a thumb-sized target, a failed save explained in the app's words; the note's window carries one action, «Modifica».
- Improved the Hall of Fame on a phone: thumb-sized note markers, the full ranking's pills at 44 px, the full table fading at its right edge while it can still scroll, and no third «Aggiungi una nota» in the sticky navbar.
- Improved the small copy of the Hall of Fame: «Leggi la nota di marzo 2024» instead of «3/2024», the Record tile's scope as its window («da dic 2022 a set 2026»), «I 12 record più grandi» over a chart that drops eight of the twenty, one sentence for an empty ranking, and two footers behind «Come si calcola».
- Improved the Coast FIRE verdict: the state pensions are named once, in the Afflussi tile with their years and annual figure; the same figure is called «numero Coast FIRE» everywhere on the tab; each scenario row prints the two rates its real return comes from («0,5% reale · 4% − 3,5%»); the method sits behind «Come si calcola».
- Improved the Ipotesi of Coast FIRE: two columns at natural height, 44 px fields and buttons on a phone, an age out of range said at the field while you type («Serve un'età intera tra 18 e 100 anni»), the true share read to a screen reader where the bar is capped at 100, and the disabled trash of the last IRPEF bracket saying why.
- Improved the shape of the FIRE Calcolatore: Base di calcolo takes the first row alone with its rows beside the pension-lock switch, Reddito passivo and Scenari share the second, and the projection chart takes whatever height is left — no more 190 px of nothing above a footer.
- Improved the axis of every chart that abbreviates: the ticks read «850k €» and «1,5 Mln €», with the euro after the figure, instead of «€850k»; the FIRE projection's tooltip drops its cents.
- Improved the Parametri form of the FIRE Calcolatore: an SWR or an INPS age out of range is said at the field while you type («Serve un valore sopra 0 e fino a 100»), the toast speaks the product's term (SWR), the trigger names the scenarios in words («crescita orso 4%, base 7%, toro 10%») and every control is 44 px tall on a phone.
- Improved the Traguardo once the target is passed: the chip reads «252,4% del numero FIRE» instead of «verso FI», and a screen reader hears the true share where the bar is capped at 100.
- Removed the confetti of «Sei già FIRE»: the verdict already says it, and the burst was the last one in the app, painted in colours no theme owns.
- Improved the FIRE Ventaglio's stability: its thousand paths are drawn with a fixed seed, so two openings show the same fan and the same Distribuzione and every comparison the lever makes is between two plans, not two throws of the dice; the Monte Carlo's «Esegui» still draws anew.

- Improved the keyboard on Allocazione, and with it every page that uses the same controls: a row of small switches in a tile's corner, and a ranked list of clickable rows, are now ONE stop of the Tab key each, with the arrows moving inside. Reaching the bottom of the page takes about half the presses it did.
- Improved the band's silence on Allocazione: changing the rebalance threshold rewrote the verdict, the plan and every chip with nothing announced. It now states the new classification for a screen reader.
- Improved the last two controls of Allocazione still smaller than the rest of the app — the exposure's «Aggiorna» and «Riprova» — and gave the custom threshold a visible label instead of a bare number box beside a stray «pp».
- Improved the order on a phone: «Modifica target» sat above every tile on Allocazione, so «change your plan» came before «read your plan». It now closes the page.
- Improved the shape of Allocazione now that the plan names instruments: Per classe rises beside Bilanciamento into one column of natural height, the plan keeps the other, and the exposure takes the full width below. The large empty space that had opened beside the plan is gone.
- Improved the plan's rows by dropping the ones that repeat themselves: a sleeve that receives the whole of its class's move and holds a single instrument printed the same figure twice under two names. The instrument survives, a sleeve that really splits keeps its level, and the plan is a third shorter.

- Improved the small switches in a tile's corner on every page («Geometrico | Traguardi», «Asset class | Liquidità», «€ | %»…): they are 32px tall on a desktop, from 28.

- Improved the last four windows that did not look like the others — the snapshot overwrite on the Panoramica, a movement's detail, the Movimenti filters, the Assistente's Conversazioni and Memoria: same heading, same size, a first line that says where you are, a sheet from the bottom on a phone and a centred window above. Conversazioni and Memoria no longer slide in from the right.

- Improved the delete of a cost center: «Conferma» with the consequence printed right under it («41 spese restano in Cashflow e perdono solo il collegamento») and the page no longer jumping. A failed delete or archive says what did not happen and why, in Italian.
- Improved the «Nuovo centro» window: the button stays enabled and a missing name or an invalid ceiling is said in the reading line, with the focus on the field, and a failed save keeps what was typed. The ceiling no longer promises a notification that nothing sends.
- Improved the readings of Centri di Costo, which repeated one total three times above the fold: the list's average is «Media 12 mesi», «Per categoria» is not shown for a center with one category, and a center born this year no longer says «quest'anno …, il 100%». «Mostra altre» is a full 44px target on a phone.

- Improved Analisi on a phone: the four-mode axis stands in two rows of 44px options instead of scrolling inside its pill (which clipped «Storico»); the month and year pickers, «Ripristina», «Vai a categoria», «Mostra tutte», the breadcrumb and the Confronto's year select are 44px on touch; the Scheda and the Confronto print whole euros like every other aggregate («1500 €», not «1499,68 €»), the oldest year row says «primo anno registrato» instead of «—», a new category in the Confronto no longer prints a dash under its badge, and the Recharts axes of the Scheda and the Dettaglio are mono with «150 €» and the typographic minus.

- Improved a movement's detail on Cashflow: the type moved above the title («Movimenti · Spesa variabile») and the note is printed whole as the title, so neither is repeated in the list under the amount.

- Improved «Aggiungi conto» on Patrimonio: it opens on the account form instead of asking «Che cosa vuoi aggiungere?» with eight choices; the asset form keeps its step counter («Passo 2 di 2 · ETF») and its labels are lower-case Italian.
- Improved Patrimonio’s two-click deletes on every row: no 3-second timer, Escape or a click elsewhere disarms, the arm is announced once per tile, and every row action names its instrument.
- Improved Patrimonio’s accessibility: the sortable headers are buttons, the actions header is named for a screen reader only, the sparklines on a phone are images and not thirteen mute tab stops, the reading order matches the visual one, the count line links to the table, the footer links and info buttons are 32px on desktop and 44px on touch.

- Improved the Dividendi form:, the record dialog, the scrape confirm and the per-year DPS dialog are in the modal vocabulary (one title size, the reading line as the status line, muted summary blocks, figures in the mono face); «Acconto» and «Saldo» replace «Interim» and «Finale»; the type filter offers only the types the period holds; the CSV export takes a different icon from the Borsa Italiana download.
- Improved the touch targets to 44px on touch across the Dividendi tab: the period axis, the view switch, the two filters, the calendar arrows, the form's fields; «Scarica storico» beside «Esporta CSV» on a phone, where both were hidden.

- Improved the snapshot overwrite on the Panoramica: the title says what the button does («Sovrascrivi lo snapshot di settembre») and the window says that the month's note is kept.
- Improved the verdict of a month with a taxed sale, on the Panoramica, Patrimonio and in the periodic email: whenever the tax explains the month the headline names it — «Settembre è in calo per le tasse sulla vendita di un ETF, non per il mercato.» or «Settembre è in pari: le tasse sulla vendita si sono prese la crescita.» instead of «Settembre sta andando bene» on a flat month. The sale then says what the month would have made without the tax («senza, il mese avrebbe fatto +3000 € (+1000 € dal mercato e +2000 € risparmiati)»), and names the tax as a fact once it is typed from the statement («pagato 260 € di tasse», no longer «pagato circa»); the estimate itself now stands on the price difference alone, as the broker computes it.
- Improved how the Panoramica and Patrimonio split the month: the quotes bought or sold during the month count as market from their trade price (a position opened this month no longer adds 0 to the «Mercato» line), and what is not market reads «risparmiati» — income minus expenses already happened — plus «di altre variazioni» when it matters (from 100 € and 5% of the change — a credit card debited the month after gives it back), instead of one «dai tuoi movimenti». The verdict's savings rate is the part already happened, with the calendar named beside it: «Hai messo da parte il 45% delle entrate finora (altri 1000 € di spese in calendario)».
- Improved the period control of the net-worth chart on the Panoramica: readable labels, thumb-sized targets on a phone, arrow-key navigation, and unselected periods that stay legible in light mode — the same control every other page uses.
- Improved the Panoramica's third row (three equal tiles) and the Costi tile, whose «Pesano di più» now follows the figures instead of leaving a gap; «Costo annuo» is no longer amber on every account.

- Improved Rendimenti › Contributi, which now gives one answer — the capital that entered the measured base, the figure every return formula removes («Nella base sono entrati 30.000 €, per la maggior parte con l'ingresso del fondo pensione nella base») — with the channels that add up to it underneath. The operations ledger and the Cashflow's savings stay on the tile as terms of comparison.
- Improved the headline figure of Rendimenti: below one year it is the return of the period («+11,8% nei 9 mesi») and the annualised rate sits beside it from six months on. The gap against the Portafoglio 60/40 is on the same basis in the verdict and in the tile, which used to print two different gaps.
- Improved Rendimenti's layout on a desktop: the three tall tiles share the first row and the others sit in two columns at their natural height, so no tile is stretched over an empty gap and the page is about a fifth shorter.
- Improved the two Rendimenti charts: «Crescita di 100» has a scale (maximum, 100, minimum), is tinted only above 100 and no longer grows to fill its tile; the portfolio is the same blue in both and «Capitale immesso» is neutral.
- Improved the Rendimenti tiles: the Benchmark column reads «Tu − modello» and «Fino a» appears only when a model stops at a different month, Sharpe and Sortino are no longer coloured like a gain, and one fiscal year of realised gains is one sentence. On a phone instrument names wrap instead of being cut, the per-instrument table folds instead of scrolling sideways, and the rolling charts' legends are readable in both themes.

- Improved Storico's layout on a desktop: Raddoppi takes the height it needs instead of stretching over an empty gap, the Driver takes the rest of the column, and the current value on the doubling track stands where the fill ends. On a phone the chips wrap in one row, the exports and «Snapshot passato» follow the content instead of standing under the verdict, and «Seleziona tutti» and the link to Allocazione are full 44px targets.
- Improved the window «Aggiungi uno snapshot passato»: the month is a list of names instead of a number from 1 to 12, and its labels lost their Title Case. With no snapshot yet, Storico says how the first one arrives in plain words («ne viene salvato uno da solo ogni sera»).

- Improved the Rendimento tile on Previdenza: each row's caption («retribuzione, non rendimento», «mercato + datore») sits on its own line under the label, so «Contributo datoriale» no longer breaks mid-word into three lines on desktop.
- Improved «Il fondo oggi»: its footer judges the age of the hand-kept value — «valore fermo dal 12 ago 2026» when the last update belongs to a closed month — instead of printing a neutral date.
- Improved the contribution flow: after a contribution the confirmation names the next step («Quando arriva l'estratto conto, aggiorna il valore del fondo: lo include già») with an «Aggiorna valore» action, so the order that prevents a double count is taught where it matters.
- Improved the fiscal-year switch on Previdenza: it scrolls inside itself once the years outgrow the row, and «Il fondo oggi» no longer recomputes when the year changes.
- Improved Previdenza on a first run: when nothing is measurable yet, the «Dettaglio» with «Come aggiornare il valore» opens by itself.
- Improved touch targets on Previdenza: 44px on phones, 32px on desktop (they were 28px) for the ledger's delete, «Mostra tutti» and the aside links; the header actions are 40px on touch.
- Improved accessibility on Previdenza: every form error is announced with its field, the year switch is a radio group, the tiles' names carry the year they show, and the ledger announces arm and cancel once instead of once per row.

- Improved Impostazioni: a category without a colour of its own now takes the theme's first chart colour instead of a fixed blue, so it follows the selected theme like everything else.
- Improved «Salva» on Impostazioni › Allocazione: a group of subcategories that does not add up is shown on its class row even when the group is closed («90% ≠ 100%»), the tile's reading names it while you type, and «Salva» — from any tab — opens that group and puts the cursor on the field to fix instead of showing a toast and leaving you there.
- Improved the Auto-calcolo of the allocation targets: age and risk-free rate now sit in the same tile as the formula they unlock. They used to live in another tab, and the switch stayed disabled until you found them.
- Improved the two-press confirmations on Impostazioni (deleting a category, syncing past dividends, and now revoking someone's access): they no longer let go after three seconds, the armed row says what the second press does («Revocando, … non vedrà più il tuo account») and screen readers hear both the arming and the release.
- Improved Impostazioni on a phone: every button, row action and link in the page is at least 44 px tall to the touch, «Ripristina default» has a name when it shows only its icon, and the Preferenze tab places its short tiles beside the tall one instead of leaving them half empty.

## 📚 Documentation

- The Cashflow guide records that a transfer's fee is an entry of its own and that a mortgage instalment repays its property by the principal, stored on the entry; the browser-test guide records what differs in a cloud container.

- The Hall of Fame guide records the three stored fields, the note prefilled from a row, the tiles' vocabulary and the page's Playwright locators; the Impeccable critique of Hall of Fame (26/40) is committed and closed, the page has its first browser tests on a fixture account with a four-year history, and the design sidecar is back in step with DESIGN.md.
- The Impostazioni guide records the save state per tab, the target rules that say where they failed, the failed reads that are never an empty list and the two-press confirms without a timer; the Impeccable critique of Impostazioni (23/40) is committed and closed, and the page has its first browser tests.

- The FIRE guide records that year 0 is a year in both walks, the new grid, the empty state's one action, the neutral legends and target lines, and that the bridge number can stay put while the SWR moves.

- The Allocazione guide records the dormant class, the two bases of the Per classe column, the rebalance's descent to the instruments, the withdrawal that solves for the amount you want in hand, and the lightness band the action colours are clamped into with the reason the old guard never ran; the Impeccable critique of Allocazione (27/40) is committed and closed by polish, and the page has its first browser tests — it was the last page with a verdict and no spec at all.
- The contributor guide records two rules that hold everywhere: a colour token read back from the browser arrives in a format nobody wrote, so anything that parses one must expect it; and a chart colour printed as text is held to the text contrast floor, not the chart one. It also records that naming a button overrides the figures inside it, which is how a table of numbers became silent to a screen reader.

- The project index is short again: each area's files and its known blind spots now open and close that area's guide, and the index keeps one line per page with the question it answers.

- The Centri di Costo guide records that a center has no pace, the risk and the fact standing on the calendar, the center held in the address, the free-colour default, the form's status line and the rules of «Collega spese…» (what is a candidate, a series as one row, the move named before the confirm, the write planned together with its undo); the Impeccable critique of Cashflow › Centri di Costo (22/40) is committed and closed by polish, and the page has its first browser tests.

- The Analisi guide records the lived pace of the Scheda, the history's ceiling, the same-days rule of the running month, the absent tile of a month not started, the Flusso's height, alignment, caps and label neutrals, and the focus return; the Impeccable critique of Analisi (26/40) is tracked in `.impeccable/critique/` and closed by polish in the same session.
- The Registro operazioni and Dividendi guides record why a sale credits its account net of the withheld tax, which gain the broker taxes, which payments credit an account and which never do, and that what reaches an account is cents.
- The Dividendi guide records the two populations (registry vs held portfolio), the form's rules, the armed row delete and the phone's chips; the Impeccable critique of Cashflow › Dividendi (23/40) is committed and closed.
- The dialog guide records how a modal names the control the focus returns to, that every window of the app now shares one shape (only the logout confirm stays an interrupting alert) and no two-click delete runs on a timer any more, and how a window grows from the button that opened it. It also records what was measured and left alone: below 769px no window takes the keyboard focus when it opens. It now also records why a window opened from a plain button loses the focus when it closes unless it is told where to return it.

- The contributor guide is shorter again (about a fifth fewer words) with nothing dropped: the rules for browser tests and emulator exercises now have a guide of their own, and each area's entry in the core file is back to the few things to know before opening that area's guide.
- The Rendimenti guide records the one answer of the Contributi tile and why an opening position is not a purchase, the headline figure below a year, the heatmap read by keyboard and touch, the two-column layout, and that the AI analysis starts when its window opens and is cancelled when it closes.
- The Storico guide records the ledger that adds up to the euro, the change that is a flow, the table that folds by its own width, the one Tab stop of a list and the two-column desktop grid; the Impeccable critique of Storico (27/40) is committed and closed in the same session, and the page has its first browser tests.
- The themes guide records that every theme, not the default alone, is now held to the same distance between its chart colours, how the four palettes were re-pitched, and what is still not asserted: the contrast of a colour against its card.

- Previdenza's guide records what was deliberately left as is and why: the snapshots query stays whole, the skeleton waits for every query, and a contribution can be deleted but not edited.
