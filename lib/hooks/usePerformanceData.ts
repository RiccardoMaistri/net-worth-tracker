/**
 * Everything Rendimenti reads, each collection ONCE (2026-10-04).
 *
 * Depth two: the six collections through the app's shared hooks (one round trip, cached across
 * pages, restored from the persisted cache on a reload), then — together, as soon as the inputs
 * are in — the pre-computed metrics (`getAllPerformanceData` on those same inputs: one `getDoc` of
 * `performance-cache/{uid}`, the expenses only on a miss) and the dividend yields of the five
 * periods (one call to `POST /api/performance/yields`). The page used to read five of the
 * collections twice and call two yield routes per period AFTER the metrics.
 *
 * The metrics are named by the service's own cache key, so they are read again exactly when an
 * input that decides them changes; the yields stay in React Query for the global `staleTime` and
 * never enter `performance-cache`, whose key covers neither the dividends nor today's prices.
