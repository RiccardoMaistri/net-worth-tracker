/**
 * Theme colour tokens resolved to `#rrggbb`, for the chart libraries that cannot take a CSS
 * colour as the browser serves it (Nivo's react-spring interpolates neither `oklch()` nor `lab()`).
 *
 * `tokens` maps a result key to a CSS custom property; `fallbacks` gives the hex painted before the
 * first read and whenever a token is missing or unreadable. The hexes come from
 * `ChartColorsProvider`, which resolves `THEME_HEX_TOKENS` (lib/utils/themePalette.ts) once per
 * theme — a token passed here must be in that list (since 2026-10-08; the five `--role-*`
 * aliases are, by construction).
 *
 * `enabled` is whether the caller will actually PAINT the colours this render. With the provider
 * mounted nothing is read here at all; without it (no dashboard layout above), the fallback read
 * runs only while enabled — disabled, no requestAnimationFrame, no getComputedStyle, no setState,
 * so a host that draws nothing with them renders once at mount. The last colours read, or the
 * fallbacks, are returned meanwhile.
 *
 * Pass module-level constants: the result is memoized on the objects' identity.
 *
 * Used by: components/cashflow/analisi/tiles/FlussoTile.tsx (the 50/30/20 Sankey's role colours).
