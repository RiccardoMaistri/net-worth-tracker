/**
 * Whether a CSS media query matches, read as an external store (`useSyncExternalStore`).
 *
 * The dashboard shell is in the prerendered HTML (since 2026-09-28), so this hook now runs on the server
 * and during hydration — where `window` does not exist and the only value that does not make React
 * report a mismatch is the server's, `false`. Right after hydration React reads the real snapshot
 * and re-renders the subscribers on its own: no error, no effect, no `setState`. A component
 * mounted LATER (every page, every dialog) is not hydrating, so it reads the real value on its first
 * render — the flash-free behaviour the old `useState(() => matchMedia(…).matches)` initializer gave,
 * kept for the surfaces that branch on the phone width.
 *
 * The one consequence: the shell's FIRST frame must be decided by CSS, never by this value. The
 * fixed sidebar is `hidden desktop:block` and the bottom nav `desktop:hidden`, so a phone paints the
 * right chrome before JS corrects `false` to `true` (`e2e/shell.boot.mobile.spec.ts` proves the
 * console stays clean).
