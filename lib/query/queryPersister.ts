/**
 * The React Query persister on IndexedDB (2026-09-29).
 *
 * IndexedDB and not `localStorage`: the owner's expenses and snapshots (with `byAsset`) run past
 * `localStorage`'s 5 MB. `idb-keyval` is the 2 KB adapter; the async-storage persister of TanStack
 * gets it as an `AsyncStorage<string>` with our own serializer, which keeps the dates
 * (lib/utils/queryPersistence.ts). The store is opened LAZILY, on the first read or write: the
 * provider creates this object on the server too, where `indexedDB` does not exist, and nothing
 * there ever calls it (a React effect is what restores).
 *
 * A write that fails — a full quota on iOS Safari, a private window that refuses the database —
 * is caught by the persister itself: the app runs exactly as it did without one.
