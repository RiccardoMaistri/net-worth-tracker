/**
 * What If Analysis service.
 *
 * Pure functions that translate a life-event scenario into adjusted FIRE inputs and then
 * compute the before/after impact on both the traditional FIRE plan and the Coast FIRE
 * plan. All heavy lifting is delegated to the existing deterministic functions in
 * fireService — this module only perturbs the baseline and diffs the results, so it stays
 * trivially testable and adds no new projection math.
 *
 * The pension bridge (the Calcolatore's model) rides along on the baseline: when the FIRE
 * lock-in toggle is on, the locked fund is a compartment that re-enters the walk at its unlock
 * year and the FIRE number is the bridge number — the same functions the Calcolatore calls, so
 * the «prima» side of this tab agrees with that tab's year. Without a bridge the walk and the
 * metrics are byte-identical to the plain model.
 *
 * See `types/whatIf.ts` for the modelling rationale (events are applied at year 0).
