 * negative netCashFlow and therefore flip positive) is an inflow. Adding contributions with a plus

 *
 * TIMELINE: t = 0 is the start of the period, where the starting valuation sits — NOT the first
 * month that happens to have movements, which is what the previous anchor used and which pulled
 * every flow forward whenever the early months were quiet. Month distances are counted as elapsed
 * months, so a flow in the first month of the period sits at t = 0 alongside the starting value, and
 * the final value sits at t = numberOfMonths.

 * crafting one). `Math.imul` keeps the multiplication in 32-bit integer space, which plain `*` would
 * not: JS numbers are doubles and would silently lose the low bits.

 *  - any snapshot added, removed OR corrected, anywhere in the history — the series hash covers all
 *    of them, where the previous key only fingerprinted the LAST one and happily served stale
 *    metrics after a historical snapshot was fixed;
 *  - the base composition (pension funds / excluded assets), which rewrites every metric while the
 *    snapshots stay untouched;
 *  - the risk-free rate, which moves every Sharpe ratio and the hero verdict built on it;
 *  - the dividend income category, which decides what counts as a contribution instead of a
 *    portfolio return — it reclassifies cash flows, so it changes ROI, CAGR, TWR and IRR too;
 *  - `CACHE_MATH_VERSION`, the manual lever for when the MATH changes but the inputs do not — the
 *    only case no input signature can detect. See its declaration for when to bump it.
 *
 * WHAT STALE COSTS: nothing is corrupted — the payload is only ever a recomputable projection of
 * Firestore data, and the 6h TTL in `getAllPerformanceData` bounds any miss of this list. The user
 * sees numbers that are internally consistent but computed from a previous input, and the Aggiorna
 * button (`forceRefresh`) always bypasses the cache. Known residual: the period boundaries depend on
 * TODAY, so on the first visit after a month rollover the cached YTD/1Y/3Y/5Y still describe the
 * previous month's window until the TTL expires or a new snapshot lands.
 *
 * A 32-bit hash can in principle collide; the key also carries the snapshot count and the last
 * month's value, so a collision would have to match all of them at once.
