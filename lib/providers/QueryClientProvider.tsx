/**
 * React Query Client Provider Configuration
 *
 * Wraps the app with React Query (TanStack Query) for API call caching and state management.
 *
 * Configuration Strategy:
 * - staleTime: 5 minutes - Data considered fresh (no automatic refetch)
 * - gcTime: 10 minutes - Cache cleanup time for unused data — 24 hours on the persisted keys
 *   (`applyPersistedQueryDefaults`), or a reload after ten minutes would restore nothing
 * - retry: 1 - Single retry on failure (default is 3, reduced for faster feedback)
 * - refetchOnWindowFocus: false - Don't refetch when user returns to tab (manual refresh preferred)
 *
 * Persistence (2026-09-29): the cache is written to IndexedDB and restored before the
 * first fetch, so a reload paints the last known figures at once (lib/constants/persistCache.ts
 * — the allowlist, the version, the retention; lib/query/queryPersister.ts — the store). Only the
 * keys of the allowlist, only successful reads, never the demo account's. The restore is
 * asynchronous: `PersistQueryClientProvider` holds every query idle (`isRestoring`) until it is
 * done, a few milliseconds after the shell (`ProtectedRoute` holds the pages until then). At
 * sign-out the cache is forgotten, in memory and on disk (`SignOutCacheGuard`).
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_PERSIST_QUERIES=false` mounts the plain provider instead — the rollback of a deploy.
 *
 * Why useState instead of useMemo?
 * React Query documentation recommends useState to ensure queryClient is created
 * only once and never recreated on re-renders. useMemo can theoretically recreate
 * the instance (React doesn't guarantee memoization), which would clear the cache
 * and cause unnecessary API calls.
 *
 * Devtools:
 * Not mounted. `@tanstack/react-query-devtools` stays installed for ad-hoc debugging of
 * cache state, but rendering it here would ship the panel to every environment.

 * Forget the cache — in memory and on disk — when the signed-in user goes away.
 *
 * On the TRANSITION from a user to none, in an effect of the provider, and not in the sign-out
 * handler: when `signOut()` resolves the pages are still mounted for one more render, and a cache
 * cleared under mounted hooks is rebuilt and refetched by them at once — with the outgoing
 * session — and written to disk again a second later (measured: five keys of the signed-out owner
 * back in IndexedDB, 2026-09-29). Here the user is already `null` in the commit that unmounted
 * the pages behind `ProtectedRoute` (children's cleanups run before a parent's effect), so no
 * observer is left to refetch. It also covers a session that ends without the «Esci» button.
 *
 * A switch from one account straight to another, with no `null` in between, is NOT covered: no
 * path in the UI produces one today (the landing and /login send a signed-in user to the
 * dashboard before a second sign-in can be pressed), and every key carries its owner, so the
 * second account never reads the first one's — the record would only outlive its owner by a day.
