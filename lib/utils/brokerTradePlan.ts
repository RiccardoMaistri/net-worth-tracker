/**
 * The import PLAN for broker trades: which rows are new, which are already in the ledger, and why
 * a row cannot be imported at all. Pure - the preview is composed in the client, which already
 * holds the tracked assets and the existing trades.
 *
 * WHY A PLAN AND NOT A WRITE. A broker history is not the user's assertion that it is correct: it
 * can hold an instrument that is not in Portafoglio, a trade dated before the asset's baseline,
 * or a sell whose lots the ledger cannot reconstruct. Writing any of those produces a replay that
 * either throws or silently misstates the position. So the rows are classified first, the user
 * sees exactly what would happen, and only the accepted ones are written - through
 * 'createAssetTransaction', which re-validates every one of them anyway.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY IS THE POINT OF THIS MODULE. The match is on (source, sourceRef) - the broker's own
 * id - never on date+isin+quantity: two identical trades on the same day are a real thing, and
 * matching on content would silently drop the second forever. A trade the user has since EDITED
 * keeps its source fields and is reported as already-imported, so a re-sync never overwrites an
 * edit and never duplicates it.

 * 2. asset-not-found - the instrument is not in Portafoglio. It is not created here: an asset
 *    needs a type, a class and a currency that only the user can choose (the same reason the
 *    broker ASSET import is a preview with per-row fields).
 * 3. asset-not-ledger - the asset exists but is cash/realestate/pensionFund, whose quantity is not
 *    the result of trading. A buy into one would be silently dropped by the replay.
 * 4. before-baseline - the trade predates the asset's own baseline, so the replay has no cost
 *    basis for it. Backfilling needs the position as it stood at that date, which only a baseline
 *    BUY can supply; it is declared, never approximated.
