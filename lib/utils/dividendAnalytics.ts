/**
 * Dividend analytics pure utilities
 *
 * All the in-memory derivation behind the redesigned "Dividendi & Cedole" tab lives
 * here, free of React, Firestore and the DOM, so it can be unit-tested in isolation.
 * The tab fetches the full dividend list once and derives every period view from it,
 * exactly like the Cost Centers Panoramica — switching period is instant and needs no
 * refetch.
 *
 * MONEY:
 * Every figure is in EUR. We always prefer the converted *Eur fields (populated for
 * non-EUR dividends via Frankfurter) and fall back to the native amount for legacy or
 * already-EUR records. A dividend is "paid" once its payment date has passed; future
 * payment dates are "upcoming" (announced but not yet cashed).
 *
 * TIMEZONE:
 * Calendar boundaries are computed in Italy time via dateHelpers, so a coupon paid late
 * on 31/12 in Italy lands in the right month/year regardless of the server's UTC offset.
 * Every function accepts an explicit `now` for deterministic tests.
