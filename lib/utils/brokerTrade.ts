/**
 * The ONE shape both broker trade importers produce — Scalable and Trade Republic, normalized.
 *
 * Two brokers, two wildly different payloads, one importer downstream. This module is the seam:
 * each broker module (`scalableTradeImport.ts`, `tradeRepublicTradeImport.ts`) parses its own wire
 * into `BrokerTrade`, and everything after that — the preview, the idempotency check, the write —
 * is broker-agnostic and never re-reads a raw payload.
 *
 * Pure, no I/O, no `server-only`: the preview is composed in the CLIENT, which already holds the
 * tracked assets, so this has to survive the bundle.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SHAPE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CARRY, and why each omission cost a decision:
 *
 * - **`priceEur`.** The ledger resolves FX server-side (`createAssetTransaction`), and the form
 *   payload does not accept one. A broker that reports a EUR total (both of them do) still
 *   reports it in the INSTRUMENT's currency, not EUR: a Sell of 4.027288 shares at €941.40 is
 *   EUR-denominated, but a US trade on a EUR account is settled in USD. Writing a converted value
 *   here would be exactly the inconsistency the server-side resolution exists to prevent.
 * - **`quantity` sign.** Always positive; the side lives in `side`, because `AssetTransactionType`
 *   maps `buy`→BUY and `sell`→SELL directly and a negative quantity is a validation error there.
 * - **Cash settlement.** `linkedCashAssetId` is deliberately absent: the broker's cash account is
 *   an `Asset` the sync may not have created yet, and a buy debits / a sell credits it. Guessing
 *   an id would move money the import has no business moving, so it stays a per-row choice.
