/**
 * ISIN → Yahoo Finance symbol, for the brokers that publish only an ISIN.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Yahoo quotes neither a real ISIN nor the pseudo-ISINs brokers assign to
 * crypto, and the exchange suffix is not in the broker payload, so it cannot be derived — a symbol
 * has to be known. That is why every broker bridge here is stuck behind a table, and why an
 * imported position with no entry is created with the ISIN as its ticker and stays unquotable.
 *
 * Only FUND entries belong here. A single stock's listing is the broker account's own business and
 * its own table (`TR_YAHOO_TICKER_BY_ISIN` in `tradeRepublicImport.ts`, which holds that account's
 * positions); a UCITS ETF's identity is a public fact both brokers need, so lifting it here is what
 * stops the two bridges from drifting apart.
 *
 * A MISSING ENTRY IS SAFE, and that is the property to preserve when adding one:
 *   - the resolver returns `null` and the caller keeps the ISIN, which is exactly where it was;
 *   - on a broker-fed position (`autoUpdatePrice: false`) a wrong symbol cannot move a price, so a
 *     bad entry costs one failed lookup, never a wrong number in the portfolio.
 * On a broker that DOES auto-update prices from Yahoo, a wrong entry would put a wrong price on a
 * real asset. So nothing here is written from memory: an entry appears only once its quote has been
 * verified to exist against Yahoo.

/**
 * The ETFs a European broker sells, keyed by ISIN. The symbol is a full Yahoo symbol including its
 * exchange suffix: the suffix cannot be derived, and guessing one is how a real asset ends up priced
 * off an unrelated listing.
 *
 * EVERY ROW HERE IS MEASURED, and the measurement is reproducible: `search(isin)` names the fund and
 * `quoteSummary(symbol, { modules: ['price'] }).longName` names what that symbol actually quotes, and
 * the two must be the same fund. The table this replaces was written from memory and was wrong on
 * 10 of its 33 rows — `IE00B4JNQZ49` filed as Vanguard All-World is iShares S&P 500 Financials,
 * `IE00B4L5Y983`'s neighbour `IE00BFY0GT14` filed as «Invesco MSCI World» pointed at iShares' own
 * fund, `LU1681048804` filed as «Amundi Prime USA» pointed at a euro government bond fund — and seven
 * ISINs were not funds at all, so nobody could ever check them. A wrong entry is worse than a
 * missing one, which is why the seven unverifiable keys are GONE rather than kept with a guess.
