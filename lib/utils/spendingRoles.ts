/**
 * The 50/30/20 split — which role a spending row plays, and what a period adds up to.
 *
 * Opt-in (`settings.spendingRolesEnabled`) and shown only in Analisi's Flusso (the Sankey, and
 * the share bar that stands for it below 640px). The role is
 * stored on the category (`ExpenseCategory.spendingRole`) with an optional per-subcategory
 * override, never on the row: a row carries `categoryId`, so reclassifying a category is
 * retroactive for every period with no bulk update. This module is the ONE place that turns
 * (row, categories) into a role; the Sankey builder and any later reader consume its output.
 *
 * RISPARMI IS NOT A CATEGORY TOTAL
 * Savings = the rows classified as `saving` PLUS the period's surplus (income − all spending).
 * A Sankey has no negative width, so when spending exceeds income the missing amount is not
 * subtracted from anything: it becomes `deficit`, drawn on the income side as «Coperto dal
 * patrimonio», and the surplus is zero. Either way both sides carry the same total:
 *   income + deficit === need + want + unclassified + saving + surplus
 *
 * Amounts follow Analisi's own totals (`summarizeFlow`) and Periodo's (`summarizePeriodCashflow`):
 * income is SIGNED, because a negative income row is a reversal of income, and spending is a
 * magnitude; the row's own `type` decides which side it is on, transfers are net-zero and skipped.
 * So «Delle entrate (X €)» here is the same X as Periodo's «Entrate» on the same page.
