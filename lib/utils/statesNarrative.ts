 * The words of an absence, and the one decision that keeps the three apart

 * A tile that cannot answer must say WHICH of three things happened — nothing is recorded ·
 * something is, and it is zero · the read failed — because the three ask the reader for three
 * different actions, and printing a zero for any of the other two is the one thing a tracker
 * must never do.
 *
 * What lives here is only what is CROSS-PAGE: the failed read (whose sentence is the same shape
 * on every surface) and the precedence between waiting and failing. The other two names are a
 * page's own words and stay in its `*Narrative.ts` — a shared module writing «Nessuno strumento
 * registrato» would be copy about Patrimonio living outside Patrimonio.
 *
 * Pure: no Firebase, no DOM, no `chartService`. Tested clause by clause.
