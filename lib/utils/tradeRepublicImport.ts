/**
 * Trade Republic read-only bridge — the pure layer behind Impostazioni → Collegamenti.
 *
 * Mirrors `scalableImport.ts` (parse → map → plan, no I/O, no server-only import) but the wire is
 * a different animal in three ways that shaped every decision below.
 *
 * 1. **THE PORTFOLIO CARRIES NO PRICE.** `compactPortfolioByType` returns
 *    `{ isin, averageBuyIn, netSize, virtualSize, status, instrumentType, name }` and nothing
 *    quotable — Trade Republic quotes a security as `ticker` on `ISIN.EXCHANGE`, and the exchange
 *    suffix is not in the portfolio payload. And the obvious fallback does not exist either:
 *    Yahoo answers NO price for a bare ISIN (measured on a stock and an ETF ISIN), so quoting
 *    `holding.isin` priced nothing and every synced position entered at 0 with a G/P of −100%.
 *    New assets are therefore born with `autoUpdatePrice: TRUE` and the best ticker the sync
 *    could resolve — the route's `yahooTicker` first (broker quote, table, OpenFIGI), the pure
 *    `resolveTrYahooTicker` otherwise — with the preview's per-row field as the last word,
 *    because guessing an exchange suffix would put a wrong price on a real asset, which is
 *    worse than a price the user points at. Consequently the plan has NO price branch at all.
 *    The one deterministic exception is crypto: its pseudo-ISIN (`XF000BTC0017`) carries the
 *    coin code, and Yahoo lists every such coin as `<CODE>-EUR` — so `resolveTrYahooTicker`
 *    writes that symbol directly, and a re-sync repairs a tracked asset whose ticker is still
 *    the raw broker id (never a hand-fixed one).
 * 2. **CASH IS A REAL BALANCE, NOT A RESIDUAL.** Scalable's cash is `valuation − securities −
 *    crypto` because that is all its overview exposes; Trade Republic publishes the cash account
 *    itself (`cash` topic, amounts in MAJOR units — the SDK's `projectCash` maps `amount`
 *    verbatim, no minor-unit division). Nothing is subtracted and nothing can go negative by
 *    arithmetic accident, so there is no residual to declare.
 * 3. **THE SAVINGS PLANS ARE A RULE, NOT A FACT.** A Sparplan ("buy €200 of VWCE on the 1st")
 *    is standing-order state at the broker: it is not a position, not a transaction, and no
 *    `Asset` field holds it. They are DECLARED in the preview and never written — the same
 *    posture the Scalable deposit's interest rate takes (`doc/guide/collegamenti.md`).
 *
 * The `savingsPlans` amount unit is the one figure here that could not be verified against a
 * live account: the SDK passes the topic value through untouched (no `projectMoney` equivalent,
 * unlike `cash`), and Trade Republic's web client sends it in minor units. It is therefore read
 * through ONE named constant, and the preview prints the computed figure so a wrong assumption
 * is visible rather than plausible. Do not inline a `100` anywhere else.
 *
 * Quantity rule (unchanged from Scalable, and the ledger owns it): for ledger types
 * (stock/etf/bond/crypto/commodity) `quantity`/`averageCost` are replay-derived and are NEVER
 * written by the sync. A mismatch is a drift warning to reconcile with a Registro adjustment.
