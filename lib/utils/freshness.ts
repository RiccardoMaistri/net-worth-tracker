/**
 * Is the page showing the last KNOWN figures while the fresh ones are in flight?
 *
 * With the query cache persisted (lib/constants/persistCache.ts) a page paints the
 * figures restored from IndexedDB at once and rereads them behind (the restore invalidates what it
 * restored: every load is a fresh read, stale-while-revalidate). The reader has to be told —
 * «Aggiornato alle 18:42, sto rileggendo…» — when what is on screen is genuinely from before:
 *
 * - a figure READ BEFORE THIS PAGE LOAD (`dataUpdatedAt < openedAt`): it came out of the persisted
 *   cache, and however young it is, it is another load's reading of the world;
 * - a figure older than its query's own `staleTime` (lib/query/queryDefaults.ts; the overview's
 *   minute) — a page left open and rereading a figure the client itself calls stale.
 *
 * A refetch of a figure read two minutes ago IN THIS session (an invalidation after a save) is
 * neither: it is the app doing what it always did, in silence.
 *
 * Pure: the hook (`lib/hooks/useFreshness.ts`) hands it the queries, the clock and the load instant.
