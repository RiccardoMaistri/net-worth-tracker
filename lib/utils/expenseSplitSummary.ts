/**
 * The numbers of Cashflow › Divisione: how a household's shared spending is split between the
 * people who live in it, and what is left of each person's income once their share is paid.
 *
 * THE MODEL, in one paragraph. Every expense row is either the household's («in comune», the
 * default, which is what an absent `personalMemberId` means) or one person's. The common
 * spending is a pool, and the income left «in comune» pays it FIRST (owner's decision,
 * 2026-09-27): what is split by the shares is `common spending − common income`, floored at zero,
 * and whatever the common income earns beyond the spending is declared as a surplus, never
 * distributed. Each person carries a share of that net pool proportional to the income
 * attributed to them in the period, and what remains to them is `their income − share of the
 * pool − their own spending`. That last figure is the point of the page: it is the money that
 * can go to a personal investment account at the end of the month.
 *
 * WHICH INCOME IS WHOSE. Every income row not attributed to a person is the household's and
 * reduces the pool — a refund on a shared bill, a gift to the couple, and a salary somebody
 * forgot to attribute alike (that last one buys nobody a share, and the basis declares it: two
 * facts about one row, both stated). Every income row attributed to a person is theirs and earns
 * them a share, WHATEVER its category (owner's decision, 2026-09-27: until then only the labor
 * categories counted, and a refund attributed to somebody was in neither the pool nor the
 * residual). An income row whose owner has since left Famiglia is neither: the user said it was
 * somebody's, so it reduces nothing, and it is declared with the spending orphans.
 *
 * THE SHARES ARE THE PERIOD'S, and that is a deliberate choice with a cost. Reading them off the
 * income actually received in the window is the most faithful answer to «how did THIS month
 * go», and it is also the most volatile: a bonus or a thirteenth month moves the percentage, and
 * a salary not yet recorded would move it to 100/0. So the shares are never guessed. When one of
 * the people has no income in the period, `resolveSplitBasis` returns `unavailable` naming who is
 * missing, and every figure that depends on the split disappears with it rather than being
 * invented — the same rule that makes an unknowable baseline `null` instead of `0` elsewhere in
 * this codebase.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. There is no reconciliation of who paid what: the question this
 * page answers is «how much is left to each of us», not «who owes whom». The paying account
 * (`linkedCashAssetId`) is therefore never read, and a couple whose common expenses leave a joint
 * account needs no extra bookkeeping to use any of this.
 *
 * Words live in `expenseSplitNarrative.ts`; nothing here formats anything.
