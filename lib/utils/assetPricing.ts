 * the asset table's `requiresManualPricing`). They drifted: only the dialog's copy knew

 * a Yahoo quote by the price cron, and never got the manual-price row tint in the table.
 *
 * The module is deliberately dependency-free (no Firebase, no yahoo-finance2) so both the
 * client bundle and server-only code can import it.
 *
 * WARNING: adding an AssetType whose value is entered by hand (statement, appraisal, NAV)
