/**
 * Shared Framer Motion animation variants for consistent motion across pages.
 *
 * All durations use ease-out-quart [0.25, 1, 0.5, 1] — the same easing as
 * the existing useCountUp hook — for a coherent motion language.
 *
 * Usage pattern:
 *   <motion.div variants={staggerContainer} initial="hidden" animate="visible">
 *     <motion.div variants={cardItem}>...</motion.div>
 *   </motion.div>
 *
 * Accessibility: wrap pages with <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"> to
 * automatically disable all animations for users with prefers-reduced-motion.
