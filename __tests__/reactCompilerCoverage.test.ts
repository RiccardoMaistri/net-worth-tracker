/**
 * Every component and hook compiles under the React Compiler.
 *
 * `reactCompiler: true` (next.config.ts, since 2026-10-05) compiles each component or hook as ONE
 * unit, and a single construct it does not support ANYWHERE inside it — a `try … finally`, a
 * `throw` inside a `try`, an `import()`, one `eslint-disable` of a `react-hooks` rule — makes it
 * skip the WHOLE component in silence: the page still works, it just re-renders everything again.
 * `npm run lint` does not see most of these (the `todo` and `hooks` rules are not in the plugin's
 * `recommended`, and «value blocks within a try/catch» reaches no ESLint rule at all), so this test
 * is the map: it runs the same Babel plugin Next runs, with a logger, over app/, components/,
 * contexts/ and lib/, and fails naming each skipped function and the compiler's reason.
 *
 * On 2026-10-05, when the compiler was turned on, the first run found 48 skipped functions, the settings, Cashflow,
 * Rendimenti, Patrimonio and Panoramica pages among them; each was rewritten without changing
 * behaviour, and the ways to do it are in AGENTS.md § Motion. Seen red that day with a
 * `try … finally` put back in a component, and with an `eslint-disable-next-line
 * react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`.
 *
 * ~12 s for ~700 files, so it runs once, in `beforeAll`, with its own timeout.
